    "title": "A common misconception about ChatGPT",
    "content": "\r\nThere's a certain way of speaking about ChatGPT, where people would say that ChatGPT ›is lying‹, or ›is wrong‹, or ›is producing false facts‹, which doesn't ring adequate to me, because when you are interacting with ChatGPT in order to get some answers to questions, it's not like typing something in a search engine or reading a Wikipedia article about the topic in question. Since ChatGPT is a language model, it doen't ›know‹ about facts . I'm surely no expert in this and my knowledge about AI and machien learnng is very inchoate. But I guess it's safe to say that GPT - same as other machine learning models - is all about predictions and statistical relations rather than retrieving collected facts from some database. (Jon Stokes' [ChatGPT Explained: A Normie's Guide To How It Works](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/chatgpt-explained-a-guide-for-normies) is a good primer and explains better what I'm trying to get at.) So, very roughly speaking, when asking ChatGPT a question it will try to produce an answer that sounds like what some other speaker of your language would plausibly say in reply to your question. It's more or less likely that it will accord to facts in the world and sound like the right answer, but that is just because ChatGPT ›knows‹ the rules of our language, not because it has some mechanism to find out about facts in the world. [As someone on Reddit pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/12hj1h6/chatgpt_is_a_sneaky_lying_bastard_and_no_it_wont/), you should »[t]hink of chatgpt as a language model alone. It isn't a knowledge model. It doesn't have intelligence. It's predicting what a person might say in response to what you say. This is a very plausible thing someone could say, if it was true, in response to you. If you want the most out of chatgpt, you shouldn't ask it knowledge based questions much but questions that are a language question in nature.«\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- »Now the Web at large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to communicate nothing.« ([1](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md)) --\u003e\r\n",

    "title": "Refactoring UI by Steve Schoger \u0026 Adam Wathan (2018)",
    "content": "\r\nHere's some personal takeaways from the *Refactoring UI* (2018) book by Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan. I really recommended [buying the actual book](https://www.refactoringui.com/), not least for all the example images in there. While those examples are really not anything I would feel excited about rebuilding (it's mostly just typical corporate website designs really), they still are really helpful in order to develop some intuition and sensibility what looks pleasing and balanced.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Limit your choices\r\n\r\nCreate a pool to choose from beforehand, e.g.\r\n    - a color pallette plus shades \r\n    - a list of possible font-sizes\r\n    - a list of margins and paddings to choose from\r\n\r\nWhen working with sizes, *don't use linear scaling*. I.e. your pool of font sizes should not be a certain number of font sizes that are each 4px apart, but rather work with a base font size and ratios like 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. \r\n\r\n## Emphasis by de-emphasizing\r\n\r\n**Try emphasizing by de-emphasizing.**\r\n\r\nInstead of having many element competing with each other for emphasis, try to de-emphasize some elements.\r\n- You can give inactive elements a lighter shade of the same color. \r\n- However, using opacity for that can have some pitfalls, it's usually better to use the \"L\" value in HSL colours. \r\n    - There's [a SASS function for that](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules#hsl).\r\n\r\n\"[R]educing contrast helps to de-emphasize heavy elements, increasing weight is a great way to add a bit of emphasis to low contrast elements.\"\r\n\r\n## Labels\r\n\r\nLabels don't always need to be treated as headlines. They might just be there to support and clarify, while the associated data is what speaks. If that's the case \"[d]e-emphasize the label by making it smaller, reducing the contrast, using a lighter font weight\".\r\n\r\nBut don't do that in cases where users might be skimming for a label or depend on the label.\r\n\r\nContrast between label and data can be achieved simply by lighter or darker colors or bold and regular font-weights.\r\n\r\n### Headlines\r\n\r\nHeadlines from `\u003ch1\u003e` to `\u003ch6\u003e` don't necessarily need to decrease in font-size progessively. Just like labels, sometimes headlines are just supportive content and shouldn't draw so much attention.\r\n\r\nFor a11y reasons, one shouldn't mix order from `\u003ch1\u003e` to `\u003ch6\u003e`. However, when the headlines don't need to be displayed (because the content speaks for itself) they can be hidden, e.g. with `display: none`.\r\n\r\n## Hierarchy \r\n\r\nHierarchy is oftentimes determined by how much surface area some element inhabits. So, font size, font weight etc. matter. \r\n\r\nHowever, contrast also matters and can create hierarchy. Instead of using weights, one can use color softness in order to achieve hierarchy.\r\n\r\nWhen designing buttons, think of the *hierarchy of actions*:\r\n- \"Primary actions should be obvious\"\r\n- \"Secondary actions should be clear but not prominent\"\r\n- \"Tertiary actions should be discoverable but unobtrusive\"\r\n\r\nDepending on where the user currently is in the UX (e.g. in an ordering process) the hierarchy of actions can change.\r\n\r\nDon't rely on contrasting colors so much in order to attain hierarchy as many different colors tend to make the UI too busy.\r\n\r\n## Spacing\r\n\r\n\u003e Start with too much white space. \r\n\r\nInstead of adding margins and paddings, try to have too much padding/margin in the beginning and then start removing some (which is also easier and more obvious to do).\r\n\r\n\u003e A spacing and sizing system will help you create better designs, with less\r\neffort, in less time\r\n\r\nDefine a set of values for spacings in advance.\r\nIt's best to work with relative values here (percentages) instead of absolute ones (pixels).\r\n\r\n\u003e If you want your system to make sizing decisions easy, make sure no two\r\nvalues in your scale are ever closer than about 25%.\r\n\r\n\u003e You don’t have to fill the whole screen\r\n\r\nAnd not everything needs to be full-width. Give elements just the space they need.\r\n\r\n\u003e If you’re building a responsive web application, try starting with a ~400px canvas and designing the mobile layout first.\r\n\r\n## Layout\r\n\r\nEven tough, grid systems like Bootstrap's 12 column grid, are useful and efficient, not all layout decisions should be based on grid systems. At least not on fixed grids (grids with equal distribution).\r\n\r\nSome elements might have *optimal sizes* and can be given fixed sizes. Like a header that should always be 100px high.\r\n\r\nRelative proportions aren't necessarily the same on all screens. For example, if a heading's font size is twice the size of the content on desktop, this 1:2 kind of proportion will probably look to extreme on mobile screens. Same for inner proportions, like font-size and padding on button elements.\r\n\r\n\u003e As a general rule, elements that are large on large screens need to shrink faster than elements that are already fairly small — the difference between small elements and large elements should be less extreme at small screen sizes.\r\n\r\nTake care of horizontal and vertical spacing in order to group content and make the relationships between elements easy to understand. (You can also use borders and dividers.)\r\n\r\n## Typeset\r\n\r\n**Define a type system beforehand.**\r\n\r\nIt's okay to handpick a list of type scales in pixel or rem values and use that. It doesn't need to be a scale based on maths and complex ratios.\r\n\r\nMake sure not to use em values in your type scale since this can easily break your type scale system when working with nested elements.\r\n\r\nIn doubt or as a fallback, you can always use the default font stack of your operating system:\r\n`-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Noto Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue;`\r\n\r\n\u003e Fonts meant for headlines usually have tighter letter-spacing and shorter lowercase letters (a shorter x-height), while fonts meant for smaller sizes have wider letter-spacing and taller lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nMake sure not to have paragraphs too narrow or too wide. Usually, 45 to 75 characters per line is a good choice. Giving your paragraph a width of something between 20 and 35em will do the job.\r\n\r\nCentering text items vertically (e.g. with `align-items: center`) will work when the items' sizes don't differ much. But when they're sizes are further apart from each other, it will look wonky. Centering to baseline (`align-items: baseline`) is usually cleaner.\r\n\r\n\u003e [Y]our line-height and paragraph width should be proportional — narrow content can use a shorter line-height like 1.5, but wide content might need a line-height as tall as 2. [...] When text is small, extra line spacing is important because it makes it a lot easier for your eyes to find the next line when the text wraps.\r\n\r\n\u003e Line-height and font size are inversely proportional — use a taller line-height for small text and a shorter line-height for large text.\r\n\r\nHyperlink don't always need to stand out. It depends on the context, if you should hihlight a link (by coloring them or by underlining on hover vel sim.).\r\n\r\n**Don't center align long text blocks.** Use center-alignment for headlines, or short independent text blocks. Otherwise use left-alignment (or right-alignment in Hebrew, Persian etc.). Numbers in tables should be right-aligned (so that decimal seperators are in place).\r\n\r\n\u003e [W]henever you justify text, you should also enable hyphenation\r\n\r\nYou don't normally need to tweak letter-spacing. \r\n\r\nOnly when you want to use a font that is used for normal text as a font for your headline, you should consider tightening the letter spacing a bit. Or when using uppercase letters only, adding a bit of letter spacing is a good idea w/r/t readability.\r\n\r\n## Colors\r\n\r\n**Consider using HSL instead of RGB and HEX** (see above). \r\n\r\n(HSL = Hue Saturation Lightness) != (HSB = Hue Saturation Brightness)\r\n\r\nA good color palette consists of three categories: *grays, primary color(s) and accent color(s)*.\r\n\r\nShades are important. For each color hue you use, you'll need 5-10 shades of it.\r\n\r\nIn color palettes it's okay to use linear increments. For example, for shades of gray, you can simply use something like: hsl(0, 0%, 5%), hsl(0, 0%, 15%), hsl(0, 0%, 25%), etc. (Or use a tool like [Micro Digital Tools' Color Shades Generator](https://mdigi.tools/color-shades).)\r\n\r\nHowever, it's always good to judge by how something looks, more than mathematical relations. (You can tweak some parameters of each color/shade afterwards of course.)\r\n\r\nThe primary color or the primary colors should your defining color(s). You will also need a handful of shades of that color.\r\n\r\nAccent colors are used to highlight and emphasize things and communicate certain states. (What is `success`,  `danger`, `warning`, `info` in Bootstrap.) These colors should be used far less than the primary colors.\r\n\r\nWhen creating palettes of shades it's a good idea to start with the middle color and then find the lightest and the darkest shade and then interpolate for the shades in between.\r\n\r\nFor lighter shades of a color it's advisable to add some saturation in order to not have them look too pale. You can also try *to rotate the hue*. So instead of increasing the L value in HSL, try to move the H value towards the nearest bright hue (i.e. 60°,\r\n180°, or 300°). Coversely, to make it look darker, move the H value towards the nearest dark hue (0°, 120°, or 240°). Changing hue and changing lightness can also be combined in order to arrive at a well-balanced colour palette.\r\n\r\n\u003e Don’t rotate the hue more than 20-30° or it will look like a totally different color instead of just lighter or darker.\r\n\r\n**Greys** by definition have a saturation of 0 (so chaging the hue won't change the grey). In order to get more interesting pseudo-grey colours, add some saturation to them. \r\n\r\n\u003e If you want your greys to feel cool, saturate them with a bit of blue [...] To give your greys a warmer feel, saturate them with a bit of yellow or orange.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility ('a11y')\r\n\r\nMany guiding rules are defined by the *Web Content Accessibility Guidelines*.\r\n\r\nColur shouldn't be the only source of meaning or means of conveying information, because people with colour blindness might not be able to grasp the informartion. So also use additional icons or something. If that's not an option, create contrasts, so even colour blind people can discern the elements. \r\n\r\n\u003e Always use color to support something that your design is already saying; never use it as the only means of communication.\r\n\r\n### Font size\r\n\r\n\u003e [N]ormal text (under ~18px) has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, and [...]] larger text has a contrast ratio of at least 3.\r\n\r\n### Contrasts \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve contrast between text and background, you don't always need to darken to background when using light text for example. \r\n\r\n\u003e Instead of using light text on a dark colored background, use dark colored text on a light colored background.\r\n\r\nIn case of dark coloured backgrounds, changing lightness and saturation in order to get a text color with a good contrast can result in a color that is almost white. Changing the hue towards cyan, yellow, or magenta will produce better results.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Depth \r\n\r\n\u003e Small shadows with a tight blur radius make an element feel only slightly raised off of the background, while larger shadows with a higher blur radius make an element feel much closer to the user. The closer something feels to the user, the more it will attract their focus. \r\n\r\nEstablish an elevation system, i.e. a hierarchy of elements and components in terms of how close they appear (for example modal to dropdown menu to button)\r\n\r\nShadows can have two parts: one that simulates the shadow cast by direct light and another as cast by ambient light: one larger, blurry, diffuse shadow plus one small, sharp, defined shadow. The second one should be less sharp the more elevated you want the shadow to look. In a flat design, you can still use sharp, vertical, unblurred shadows. However, establishing hierarchy will be tricky here.\r\n\r\nYou can also create a sensation of depth without shadows, only by using colours, because »lighter objects feel closer to us and darker objects feel further away.«\r\n\r\nAnother option to create depth is by overlapping elements and thus creating layers.\r\n\r\n## Images and photos\r\n\r\n\u003e Bad photos will ruin a design, even if everything else about it looks great.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to place text on top of a photo in order for the text to be readable still, you should a semi-transparent overlay to the image: a dark overlay for light text; for dark text add a light overlay or reduce contrast. Other than that you can also apply a glow or very blurry shadow to set the text apart from the background image.\r\n\r\nYou can also colourize the image to a colour that goes well with your text colour. \r\n\r\nThree steps to get a colorized image:\r\n- lower the contrast of the image\r\n- desaturate the image to remove colours\r\n- add a colour fill and use multiply mix mode \r\n\r\nScaling up images is usually not a good idea as it will not look good. That's also true for vector icons, which won't lose quality when scaling them up. It's better to use icons at their intended size and add a circle, square etc. with an appropriate background colour to the icon so as to fill the space in your layout.\r\n\r\nScaling images down can also produce unwanted results. Favicons, for example, will probably look blurry and washy when scaled down. That's even the case with popular tools like [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). It's better to create seperate icons for different sizes and to simplify them where necessary.\r\n\r\n\u003e Don’t scale down screenshots.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent background bleed (image colours bleeding into your background colour), you *could* use a border. However, a more appealing solution is a discreet inset box shadow.\r\n\r\n## miscellaneous\r\n\r\nTo make your page more interesting and appealing it's often a good idea to replace browser defaults, like bullet icons, radio buttons, checkboxes etc. with custom styles.\r\n\r\nUse accent borders in order to make elements stand out visually. \r\n\r\nMake sure you're not only using borders to seperate content as it will make your UI look too busy soon. Drop shadows or inset shadows are more subtle and can serve the same purpose as borders. Also different background colours (not necessarily alternating background colours as in an Excel sheet) or more spacing will seperate items from another.\r\n\r\n\u003e A great way to break up some of the monotony without drastically altering the design is to add some excitement to a few of your backgrounds.\r\n\r\nYou can also use background patterns, which you can create yourself or get from pages like [heropatterns.com](https://heropatterns.com/) or [magicpattern.design](https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds). When using such, sticking to simple geometric shapes and low contrasts will normally produce the most appropriate results, ensure readability and don't distract too much from the content.\r\n\r\n\u003e If you’re designing something that depends on user-generated content, the empty state should be a priority, not an afterthought. [...] Empty states are a user’s first interaction with a new product or feature. Use them as an opportunity to be interesting and exciting [...]\r\n\r\n\u003e Look for decisions you wouldn’t have made.\r\n\r\n\u003e Rebuild your favorite interfaces.",

But since I didn't really use it, it was in still in great condition. Not a lot of hours on its back.\r\n\r\nThere was quite a run on this item. A bunch of guys wrote to me that they were looking for that thing for years. Just out of curiosity I was asking, what are they planning to do with an near 20 years old graphics card. Apparently, there was a lot of biographical nostalgia involved with some of the prospective buyers. One of them said, he wanted to finally assemble the kind of PC he couldn't afford as a teenager. The person I eventually sold the card to said that, besides being a collector of vintage graphic cards, this is the exact same card he owned back in the day and that's why he really wants it again. He's also very much into old gear and it's a lot of fun to him. Also, when stuff is broken he likes to repair it.\r\n\r\nI don't really get that people are nostalgic for these kinds of things, even though I'm susceptible for Y2K nostalgia myself and I do love the box art of those old graphics cards:\r\n\r\n![Gainward Powerpack Ultra graphics card box](/geforce.jpg)\r\n",

    "content": "\r\n## Maggie Nelson\r\n\r\nI'm constantly amazed by the lucidity of Maggie Nelson's writing and here's multi-faceted analyses. Damn, even the [@MaggieNelsonBot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaggieNelsonBot) that generates mostly nonsensical aphorisms from parts of sentences out of Maggie Nelson's books is a great read. (Their actually not nonsensical to me, just oftentimes syntactically incorrent—just like poetry.) Since her essays are often so dense that a lot of ideas slip through my fingers when I don't contemplate them again, I collect a bunch of quotes here.\r\n\r\n\u003e The image of the Marlboro man riding his horse and smoking his cigarette has struck with me for many years…all it means is that the image seduced me…it didn’t widen my sensibilities, compassion or intuition. Whereas an art that affects you in the moment, but which you then find hard to remember, is straining to bring you to another level. It offers images and ideas from that other level, that other way of being, which is why you find them hard to remember. But it has opened you to the possibility of growing into what you are not yet, which is exactly what art should do.\r\n\r\n(Richard Foreman: _Unbalancing Acts. Foundations for a Theatre_)\r\n\r\n\u003e We abide by cultural directives that urge us: clarify each thought, each experience, so you can cull from them their single, dominant meaning and, in the process, become a responsible adult who knows what he or she thinks,' Foreman has said. 'But what I try to show is the opposite: how at every moment, the world presents us with a composition in which a multitude of meanings and realities are available, and you are able to swim, lucid and self-contained, in that turbulent sea of multiplicity.\r\n\r\n(Richard Foreman: _Unbalancing Acts. Foundations for a Theatre_)\r\n\r\n\u003e 'Trans' may work well enough as shorthand, but the quickly developing mainstream narrative it evokes ('born in the wrong body,' necessitating an orthopedic pilgrimage between two fixed destinations) is useless for some—but partially, or even profoundly, useful for others? That for some, 'transitioning' may mean leaving one gender entirely behind, while for others—like Harry [Dodge], who is happy to identify as a butch on T—it doesn’t? I’m not on my way anywhere, Harry sometimes tells inquirers. How to explain, in a culture frantic for resolution, that sometimes the shit stays messy? I do not want the female gender that has been assigned to me at birth. Neither do I want the male gender that transsexual medicine can furnish and that the state will award me if I behave in the right way. I don’t want any of it. How to explain that for some, or for some at some times, this irresolution is OK—desirable, even (e.g., 'gender hackers')—whereas for others, or for others at some times, it stays a source of conflict or grief? How does one get across the fact that the best way to find out how people feel about their gender or their sexuality—or anything else, really—is to listen to what they tell you, and to try to treat them accordingly, without shellacking over their version of reality with yours?'\r\n\u003e (_The Argonauts_)\r\n\r\n\u003e I, too, have often wondered whether there exists a greater pleasure than the feeling—however brief or illusory—that by writing, one is in fact incinerating layers of crap rather than tossing more of it onto the landfill. This can be a difficult feeling to achieve when the medium is language. One cannot simply offer up a white page and a stopwatch and produce the illuminating, cleansing effect of ›silence‹ [...]\r\n\u003e (_The Art of Cruelty_)\r\n\r\n\u003e Who would want [...] a world in which everything nice were partitioned off from everything horrible, thereby draining the world of its wild, nearly unnavigable paradoxes? And who would want a feminism—or any form of social justice—that lessened our apprehension of such difficult coexistences, or diminished our access to this electrical current?\r\n\u003e (_The Art of Cruelty_)\r\n\r\n\u003e Perhaps the confusion lies in the ›personal is political‹ formulation itself, which offers but a simple copula where there actually exists a multitude of possible relations. As Jacqueline Rose has put it in The Haunting of Sylvia Plath, it isn’t just that ›the personal is political—for a long time feminism has insisted that what goes on in private is a political matter that concerns us all,‹ but rather that ›psychic life in itself will not be relegated to the private, it will not stay in its proper place. It shows up on the side of the historical reality to which it is often opposed.‹ It’s this inappropriate ›showing up‹ that interests me—a kind of crashing of the party that cannot be stopped, only contended with, when it occurs.\r\n\u003e (_The Art of Cruelty_)\r\n\r\n\u003e [Lars] von Trier’s cruelty does not lie in any capacity to strip away cant or delusion, but rather in an ability to construct malignant, ultimately conventional fictions that masquerade as parables of profundity, or as protests against the cruelties of the man’s world in which we must inevitably live and suffer. Or, worse—and more likely—von Trier means to present these fictions with tongue so firmly in cheek that if we take them as parables of profundity, the joke may be on us. Von Trier imbues René Girard’s notion of sacrificial violence with an ironic, perhaps even a campy sensibility. But unlike the campiness of, say, Paul McCarthy or John Waters, von Trier keeps his cards close to his chest, as if to preserve his right—and the culture’s—to an entrenched, inevitable chauvinist malevolence. [...] Misogyny, when expressed or explored by men, remains a timeless classic. I suppose, in the end, I remain grateful to ›Breaking the Waves‹ for one thing: it spoke to a question I’ve had for some time—namely, what purpose could a female Christ serve in the (male) imagination? As writer Eileen Myles has put it, ›What would be the point in seeing [a woman] half nude and nailed up? Where’s the contradiction? [...]‹ The cruelty of Breaking the Waves is its revelation, intentional or not, that there could be no sustaining contradiction—that the redundancy of female victimization inflates into a sickening, fundamentally unbelievable martyrdom.\r\n\r\n## Gregory Bateson\r\n\r\n\u003e [I]n no system which shows mental characteristics can any part have unilateral control over the whole.

(“Forgetting”, 1981)\r\n\r\n\u003e [I]f discourse analysis archivizes archives, it is not to reconstruct the unity and continuity of a history, but quite the contrary: to dissolve the phantasm of world history into many individual storage devices which themselves were forgotten and/or retained. (“Forgetting”, 1981)\r\n\r\n\u003e Symbolic elements, however, have their position and their existence in networks. [...] Every link in the chain derives its function from its delimitation. (“Forgetting”, 1981)\r\n\r\n## Astral Codex Ten\r\n\r\n\u003e If you want good advice about how to walk, ask someone with cerebral palsy. They experience walking as a constant battle to overcome their natural constitution, and so accumulate tips and tricks throughout their lives. Or ask a physical therapist who works with these people and studies them. Just don’t ask someone you see walking especially briskly down the street. ([source](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/you-dont-hate-polyamory-you-hate))\r\n\r\n\u003e You live in a world choked with ideas, where anything that rises to your consideration has necessarily won a Darwinian battle among hyper-specialized memetic replicators competing for your attention. By definition most of what you come across through semi-formal channels will be preachy, pushy, and associated with the kind of people who are obsessed with talking about themselves. If you learn about some lifestyles through informal channels (eg your family and friends), and others through semiformal channels (eg media and books), the latter will look obviously inferior.

(from “[The Swimmer](https://archive.is/JSj0R)”)\r\n\r\n## Erich Kästner\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I didn't particularly like. Not just because this kind of tame and objective literature that aims to be instructive reminded me of German classes in school too much. Most of all, I guess I just don't like Kästner's language. I concede that it's an interesting snapshot of German history and a pertinent warning against Nazi totalitarianism. It might also be the 93-year gap to this book's publication, but the humor in »Fabian« doesn't spark for me at all and the characters are ultimately too indifferent, too normal and the book's episodes come off as too deliberate, which makes the book lack an appropriate political punch. I have [Walter Benjamin](http://www.glanzundelend.de/Artikel/abc/b/benjamin_melancholie.htm) on my side in my disfavor who also thought that Kästner's leftism was more entertainment than intervention. Nevertheless, I did find a few strong sentences in it:\r\n\r\n\u003e Was sollen wir anfangen? Wenn wir einen Mann liebhaben, liefern wir uns ihm aus. Wir trennen uns von allem, was vorher war, und kommen zu ihm. \"Da bin ich\", sagen wir freundlich lächelnd. \"Ja\", sagt er, \"da bist du\", und kratzt sich hinterm Ohr. Allmächtiger, denkt er, nun habe ich sie auf dem Hals. Leichten Herzens schenken wir ihm, was wir haben. Und er flucht. Die Geschenke sind ihm lästig. Erst flucht er leise, dann flucht er laut. Und wir sind allein wie nie zuvor. Ich bin fünfundzwanzig Jahre alt, und von zwei Männern wurde ich stehengelassen. Stehengelassen wie ein Schirm, den man absichtlich irgendwo vergisst.\r\n\r\n\u003e \"Ich kann doch nichts.\"\r\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Du kannst vieles.\"\r\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Das ist dasselbe\", meinte Fabian. \"Ich kann vieles und will nichts. Wozu soll ich vorwärtskommen? Wofür und wogegen? Nehmen wir einmal an, ich sei der Träger einer Funktion. Wo ist das System, in dem ich funktionieren kann? Es ist nicht da, und nichts hat Sinn.\"\r\n\r\n\u003e Ich kann, wenn ich meinen augenblicklichen Zustand betrachte, sagen: Die ganze Richtung paßt mir nicht! Aus den Bezirken, in die ich gehöre, wies man mich aus. Dort, wo man mich aufnehmen will, will ich nicht hin. Sei mir nicht böse, mein Guter, ich haue ab. Europa wird auch ohne mich weiterleben oder zugrunde gehen, es hat mich nicht nötig.\r\n\r\n\u003e \"Der biß zu und kämpfte und schlug mit dem Federhalter um sich, als sei der Gänsekiel ein Schleppsäbel. Der war zum Kämpfen da, du nicht. Der lebte gar nicht seinetwegen, den gab es gar nicht privat, der wollte gar nichts für sich. Und als er sich doch auf sich besann, als er vom Schicksal Frau und Kind verlangte, da brach alles über ihm zusammen und begrub ihn. Und das war in Ordnung. Wer für die anderen dasein will, der muß sich selber fremd bleiben. Er muß wie ein Arzt sein, dessen Wartezimmer Tag und Nacht voller Menschen ist, und einer muß mitten darunter sitzen, der nie an die Reihe kommt und nie darüber klagt: das ist er selber. Hättest du so zu leben vermocht?\"\r\n\r\n\u003e \"Früher verschenkte man sich und wurde wie ein Geschenk bewahrt. Heute wird man bezahlt und eines Tages, wie jede bezahlte und benutzte Ware, weggetan. Bezahlung ist billiger, denkt der Mann.\"\r\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Früher war das Geschenk etwas ganz anderes als die Ware. Heute ist das Geschenk eine Ware, die null Mark kostet. Diese Billigkeit macht den Käufer mißtrauisch. Sicher ein faules Geschäft, denkt er. Und meist hat er recht. Denn später präsentiert ihm die Frau die Rechnung. Plötzlich soll er den moralischen Preis des Geschenks rückvergüten. In seelischer Valuta. Als Lebensrente zu zahlen.\"\r\n\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Genauso ist es\", sagte sie. \"Genauso denken die Männer. Aber warum nennen Sie dann dieses Atelier einen Saustall? Hier sind doch die Frauen so ähnlich, wie ihr sie haben wollt! Oder etwa nicht? Ich weiß, was euch zu eurem Glück noch fehlt. Wir sollen zwar kommen und gehen, wann ihr es wollt. Aber wir sollen weinen, wenn ihr uns fortschickt. Und wir sollen selig sein, wenn ihr uns winkt. Ihr wollt den Warencharakter der Liebe, aber die Ware soll verliebt sein. Ihr zu allem berechtigt und zu nichts verpflichtet, wir zu allem verpflichtet und zu nichts berechtigt, so sieht euer Paradies aus. Doch das geht zu weit!\" Fräulein Battenberg putzte sich die Nase. Dann fuhr sie fort: \"Wenn wir euch nicht behalten dürfen, wollen wir euch auch nicht lieben. Wenn ihr uns kaufen wollt, dann sollt ihr teuer dafür bezahlen.\" Sie schwieg.\r\n\r\n## Justin Smith-Ruiu\r\n\r\n\u003e Most of my fellow philologists are willing to concede, at least in whisper, that what we managed to capture from the Earth’s satellites just before the solar flare hit is rather slim pickins indeed: a few “Cuck Fantasy” gifs now constituting the Tumblr Codex; a handful of Crazy Frog videos [...] making up the Archivium Amphibianum; the YouTube Cache, which includes one video of some sort of celebratory numerological rite in worship of the series of natural numbers, another of an unidentified paramilitary faction boasting of its mighty war-engines, and, as we all know from day one of Intro to Codicology, a clip of the “Brooklyn science comedian” Molly Gottstauk getting robustly booed when she tries out her new one at open-mic night: “So the guy at Chopt said ‘Now pick your protein!’ And I was like, ‘Uh, guanine?’” (from [An Introduction to Philology](https://www.the-hinternet.com/p/an-introduction-to-philology)\r\n",

Not to the point that the film's unenjoyable. There's aspects of \"The Doom Generation\" I found very fresh and it's clearly a film that came from the heart of the director. [...]\r\nThat being said though, Rose McGowan\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\npost\r\n\r\nI thought #eventim had the de facto monopoly in event ticketing in Germany 'til I remembered that #ticketmaster also operates in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative and alarming as @zdfmagazin@edi.social's latest episode was, I guess they're not where one should stop critizing this economy.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\nhttps://money4nothing.podbean.com/e/world-meta-boss/\r\n\r\nI mean, which venue wants to resort to handling ticketing themselves again? I know there's mid-sized venues here in Leipzig, who are also forced to cooperate with #tixforgigs, despite their reservations towards them and their system of fees etc. That's because it'd too much extra work having to handle the ticketing themselves.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there's still some small ticket sales points here, e.g. #CultonTicket. But apparently those are only practical for and known to people living here, not for people from other parts of Germany. The big companies still got much more reach and are convenient enough for customers.\r\n\r\nAnd then, who would want to start an ethical and fair ticketing company just for the sake of it. [...]\r\n\r\nSo I guess eventim, ticketmaster and the likes are here to stay.\r\n\r\n#witzefrei\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## title: \"The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe Who Lived for Twenty and Eight Years All Alone on an Inhabited Island and Said It Was His (2023)\"\r\n\r\nOne of those movies that left me unimpressed while watching, but which I ended up sort of liking after the Q\u0026A with the director. Benjamin Deboosere retells the story of Robinson Crusoe and turns everything which makes the original book so excruciating on its head, bringing out the colonialist phantasies and ludicrous romances of adventure of the original in all its ridiculousness. Not knowing the book though, I didn't always knew what I was actually watching and how the parts connect and also sometimes didn't know why I'm actually watching it right now. That is, I still don't understand the narrative value of some chapters—such as the one with Gio, the goat (even though that chapter was quite cute). But anyway, the movie has enough visual ideas and beautiful sets and costumes and generally a nice look to it to keep it entertaining, even when I expected a bit more excitement, for example because the opening credits stated that the cannibals in the movie will be portrayed by a queer dance company, if I remember correctly. But the actual dance scene wasn't particularly impressive and made me realize that a little more energy and verve and perhaps a proper musical film interlude here and there wouldn't have done the film any harm, as it was a bit of an understatement.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was part of Benjamin Deboosere's plan to take up various well-known chapters from the book in the movie and since the book is—according to Deboosere—extremely bad and boring, it was obviously not possible to redeem every chapter of the original book from the its boredom or predictability by means of beautiful images, narrative changes and cool actors\\*.\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nThis is a list and collection of interesting patches for the [Axoloti](http://www.axoloti.com/) instrument, which seems to be slowly dying as a project, unfortunately. At the moment of writing this, [the community forum](http://community.axoloti.com/) is giving me a `Bad Gateway` error and the project seems to be [kind of abandoned](https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti) by its creator. Though there was a handful of people still active in the forum. Maybe the forum, which was also a place for sharing patches, will be back soon. But just in case, here's some great patches I salvaged from there:\r\n\r\n- [Drone_Machine.axp](/Axoloti_patches/Drone_Machine.axp) by gui7\r\n- [hardc0re k1ck midi.axp](/Axoloti_patches/hardc0re\u0026#32;k1ck\u0026#32;midi.axp) by KelvinT\r\n- [midi looper full fat v5.0.axp](/Axoloti_patches/midi-looper-full-fat-v5.0.axp) by MattilynMattroe\r\n- [midi looper basic cheap v5.0.axp](/Axoloti_patches/midi-looper-basic-cheap-v5.0.axp) by MattilynMattroe\r\n- [mono2poly.axp](/Axoloti_patches/mono2poly.axp) by Ott\r\n- [ORGAN_1](/Axoloti_patches/ORGAN_1) by floodcomics\r\n- [supergran_v1.0.axp](/Axoloti_patches/supergran\u0026#32;v1.0\u0026#32;upload.axp) by MattilynMattroe\r\n\r\nAnd here's some patches I found elsewhere:\r\n\r\n- [6 voice karplus strong](/Axoloti_patches/karplus-1.zip) by [dreamer](https://patchstorage.com/author/dreamer/)\r\n- [AxolotiPatches](https://github.com/vormplus/AxolotiPatches) by [vormplus](https://github.com/vormplus)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, the objects from the [Axoloti Community Library](http://www.privatepublic.de/public/community-objectlist.html) are great in themselves. They're in the respective [axoloti Github repo](https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti-contrib).\r\n\r\nThe Axoloti really is a great platform and probably the most affordable soundboard for creating your own instruments and devices. The patcher is quite intuitive and easy to learn. With little effort you could build practical devices, intricate instruments etc. Much like you can do with the [monome norns](https://norns.community/) or the [Zynthian](https://norns.community/), but at a fraction of the price (though the Axoloti allows for not as complex patches as does the norns for example).\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nThere's [an initiative now in the llllllll forum](https://llllllll.co/t/axoloti-core-derivatives/3591/162) to back up the Axoloti forum. There's also a recreation of the Axoloti based on modularity called [Ksoloti (Core)](https://www.instagram.com/ksoloti.axo/), which is also discussed in the llllllll forum and in [a thread on modwiggler](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=277847).\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Using an Edirol UA-25 audio interface on Windows 11",
    "content": "\nSince the Edirol UA-25 is no class compliant device, it's not plug \u0026 play and needs a dedicated driver in order to run. The official driver is only supported up to Windows 8, but there's a little trick on how to still get it to run on Windows 11.\n\n1. Download the latest official driver from Roland for the UA-25. It should be `ua25_w81d_v101`.\n2. In the zip, find the files `RDIF1046.INF` in `ua25_w81d_v101\\Files\\64bit\\Files` or `ua25_w81d_v101\\Files\\32bit\\Files`\n3. Replace the following line:\n\n```\n[Roland.NTamd64.7]\n;; not supported\n```\n\nwith:\n```\n[Roland.NTamd64.7]\n;; Windows11\n%RDID0046DeviceDesc%=RDID0046Install, USBVID_0582\u0026PID_0074 ; UA-25\n```\n\n4. Windows will detect that the driver was modified and prevent it from being installed, because it seems corrupted. Thus, you need to disable driver signature enforcement from Powershell like so:\n\n```powershell\nbcdedit /set testsigning off\n```\n\n5. In case you get a \"protected by Secure Boot policy\" notification, enter advanced startup on Windows 11 by holding down SHIFT while clicking \"Restart\".\n6. Click \"Choose an Option\"\u003e\"Troubleshoot\"\u003e\"Advanced Options\"\u003e\"Startup Settings\"\u003e\"Restart\"\u003e\"disable driver signature Enforcement\"\n\n7.

    "title": "Setting up a www subdomain on a self-hosted Ghost blog",
    "content": "\r\n[Ghost](https://ghost.org) CMS makes it fairly easy to link your blog to your own domain and set up SSL. The `ghost setup` command in [ghost-cli](https://ghost.org/docs/ghost-cli/) basically does it for you. However, for me it didn't automatically set up a www subdomain. So I could access, say, `https://myblog.lol`, but `https://www.myblog.lol` would result in a `502`. I was thinking of just adding a CNAME or ALIAS record in my provider's DNS settings, but that didn't work somehow. So I just set an A record to point from www to the IP of my Ghost blog, which worked fine, but I didn't have any SSL then on my www subdomain. Thus, I had to tinker a bit in the nginx configs of Ghost, so that it automatically redirects all www traffic to the apex. I think that that's a pretty safe solution.\r\n\r\nFirst, I would configure the www url by `cd`ing into `/var/www/ghost` and run `ghost config url https://www.myblog.lol`.\r\nThen configure ssl via `ghost setup nginx ssl`. Set my config again to the apex domain with `ghost config url https://myblog.lol`. And now you will have to edit the nginx configs in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. Go there, and if there are no files called `www.myblog.lol-ssl.conf` **and** `www.myblog.lol.conf` create them. The first one will have to look like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 443 ssl http2;\r\n    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;\r\n\r\n    server_name www.myblog.lol;\r\n    root /var/www/ghost/system/nginx-root;\r\n\r\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/www.myblog.lol/fullchain.cer;\r\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/www.myblog.lol/www.myblog.lol.key;\r\n    include /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf;\r\n\r\n    location / {\r\n        return 301 https://myblog.lol$request_uri;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location ~ /.well-known {\r\n        allow all;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    client_max_body_size 1g;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter one should be this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 80;\r\n    listen [::]:80;\r\n\r\n    server_name www.myblog.lol;\r\n    root /var/www/ghost/system/nginx-root; # Used for acme.sh SSL verification (https://acme.sh)\r\n\r\n    location / {\r\n       return 301 https://myblog.lol$request_uri;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location ~ /.well-known {\r\n        allow all;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    client_max_body_size 50m;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it. Run `sudo nginx -t` to make sure you don't have any typo in your config files and then source your config files with `sudo nginx -s reload`. You might have to do `ghost restart`, if your www subdomain does not work immediately.\r\n",

    "title": "Virtual gaming networks with something other than Hamachi",
    "content": "\r\nThough I ain't much of a gamer anymore, I was interested to check what kind of strategies people use these days for creating virtual gaming networks and was surprised to see that LogMeIn's Hamachi, which I've used in the 00's at private LAN parties or when playing games via ISDN connection, is still utilized a lot. Other options are commercial VPN providers, some of which have specialized in offering gaming networks.\r\n\r\nHowever, my intuition was that you can also use Wire Guard-based tools these days for building gaming networks. And [apparently you can](https://tailscale.com/blog/hamachi/). Here's two applications I cam across:\r\n\r\n- [innernet](https://github.com/tonarino/innernet)\r\n- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/blog/hamachi/)\r\n\r\nI'll post my experiences with these two here eventuall, when I've tried them out.\r\n\r\nNote that, Tailscale provides a default coordination/control server with some limitations. For example you can only have one user account, so if your gaming via Tailscale, you'll all need to log in to the same account. That being said, when you don't trust your co-players or when your infrastructure scales, you might consider hosting your own control server with [headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) or paying for a Tailscale plan. `innernet` however is completely free and self-hosted by default.\r\n",

    "title": "listmonk newsletter manager on an Apache server",
    "content": "\r\nSince we're living in times of [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) and you can't trust newsletter services like Mailjet or Mailchimp anymore to be usable in a few years or months unless you are a company who can afford their services, it's good to look for other viable options - like selfhosting a newsletter manager. I'm using [listmonk](https://listmonk.app) for this as I found it is intuitive to use, fairly easy set up and the admin interface looks pleasingly non-bloated. You can simply install it with Docker. However, I was following [this guide](https://mumaritc.hashnode.dev/how-to-install-listmonk-using-binary-on-ubuntu-2204) for installing it with the binaries. You should be able to have it up and running pretty fast with this guide, but it doesn't say how to configure your Apache server for your listmonk installation.\r\n\r\nMy listmonk is running on the same server as my website and is accessible from a subdomain like `https://newsletter.myparty.de`. So I had to configure Apache as a reverse proxy that routes traffic coming to `newsletter.*` to the listmonk service which is running on port `9000` (if you followed the above tutorial).\r\n\r\nFirst, in order to use Apache as a reverse proxy enable the respective modules:\r\n\r\n`sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http`\r\n\r\nNext, create a seperate Apache config file with `sudo touch /etc/apache2/sites-available/newsletter.conf` and edit it with `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/newsletter.conf`, pasting in the following configurations:\r\n\r\n```conf\r\n\u003cVirtualHost *:80\u003e\r\n    ProxyPreserveHost On\r\n    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:9000/\r\n    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:9000/\r\n\r\n    ServerName newsletter.myparty.de\r\n    ServerAdmin info@myparty.de\r\n\r\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\r\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\r\n\r\n    RewriteEngine on\r\n    RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =list.pracht-ev.net\r\n    RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]\r\n\u003c/VirtualHost\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we have to enable our new site: `sudo a2ensite newsletter` - and restart apache: `sudo systemctl restart apache2`. You also have to make sure, by the way, that you've got an A or AAAA record set up for the `newsletter.*` subdomain at your domain registrar, otherwise, in the next step, Certbot will complain.\r\n\r\nSo, enable HTTPS for your subdomain with `sudo certbot --apache`. Certbot will do everything for you and you should end up with a `newsletter-le-ssl.conf` file in your `sites-available` folder. Restart Apache again and make sure everything is running: `sudo systemctl status`.\r\n\r\nlistmonk should now be available under `https://newsletter.myparty.de`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor reference, here's what your `config.toml` should basically look like:\r\n\r\n```conf\r\n[app]\r\naddress = \"localhost:9000\"\r\nadmin_username = \"Qwertzuiop\"\r\nadmin_password = \"1234567890\"\r\n\r\n[db]\r\nhost = \"localhost\"\r\nport = 5432\r\nuser = \"newsletter\"\r\npassword = \"ASdfGHJKLÖä#\"\r\ndatabase = \"listmonk\"\r\nssl_mode = \"disable\"\r\nmax_open = 25\r\nmax_idle = 25\r\nmax_lifetime = \"300s\"\r\nparams = \"\"\r\n```\r\n",

    "title": "Multitrack-recording from SuperCollider to Ableton (on Windows 10)",
    "content": "\r\nLast weekend I managed to get a multitrack routing from TidalCycles/SuperCollider to Ableton in Windows 7 using JACK. For anyone still interested in this, here's a quick tutorial:\r\n\r\nWhat you'll need to do is install [JACK for Windows](https://jackaudio.org/downloads/) first.\r\nThen go `C:\\Program Files\\JACK2\\jack-router` or wherever you installed it to and open the `JackRouter.ini` file in the `win32` (or `win64` folder respectively), which should look like this:\r\n\r\n![step 1](/MultitrackAudioToAbletonWin10/01.jpeg)\r\n\r\nIn there, you should change the 2nd line to the desired number of channels that you want. (I got it working with 8, but when going above 8 I got errors in SuperCollider sometimes.)\r\n\r\nNext, launch `C:\\Program Files\\JACK2\\qjackctl\\qjackctl.exe` -\u003e `Settings` - under `Driver` choose `portaudio` and under `Advanced` use settings similar to these:\r\n\r\n![step 2](/MultitrackAudioToAbletonWin10/02.jpeg)\r\n\r\n(Note that \"UA25\" is my soundcard, so you should choose your sound device or use ASIO4ALL. ASIO is the best choice for getting multi track audio, but you can try the other options in there as well.)\r\n\r\nClick `Apply` and then `Okay`.\r\nIn `qjackctl` click the Start button with the green arrow.\r\n\r\nThen, in `SuperCollider` evaluate these two lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer.default.options.inDevice_(\"ASIO : JackRouter\");\r\nServer.default.options.outDevice_(\"ASIO : JackRouter\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nand boot with your startup script. (Make sure to assign enough orbits as explained here: [Audio Outputs | Tidal Cycles](http://tidalcycles.org/docs/configuration/AudioConfig/audio_outputs/))\r\n\r\nNow in the SC post window it should say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequested devices: \r\nIn (matching device found): - ASIO : JackRouter  \r\nOut (matching device found): - ASIO : JackRouter\r\n```\r\n\r\nClick the `Graph` button in `qjackctl` and you should see something like this:\r\n![step 3](/MultitrackAudioToAbletonWin10/03.jpeg)\r\n\r\nNow open up Ableton, go to `Options` -\u003e `Preferences` and choose these settings:\r\n![step 4](/MultitrackAudioToAbletonWin10/04.jpeg)\r\n\r\n(Make sure to activate the 8 audio inputs under `Input Config` like in the picture.)\r\n\r\nThen go back to `qjackctl` Graph and re-connect the wires there like so:\r\n\r\n![step 5](/MultitrackAudioToAbletonWin10/05.jpeg)\r\n\r\n...and that's basically it!\r\n\r\n![step 6](/MultitrackAudioToAbletonWin10/06.jpeg)\r\n\r\nSet up your audio tracks in Ableton and GO!",

    "title": "PHP: Implementing a 'Remember me' function",
    "content": "\r\nThere's surprisingly little articles out there, which explain how to securely keep a user logged in by using cookies in PHP. (Or if there is one, it's only [in the web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20110219130748/http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice).) Even some articles claiming to show the [best approach](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-approach-for-keep-me-logged-in-using-php/) to do so, [will advise you](http://www.phpnerds.com/article/using-cookies-in-php/2) to e.g. store the MD5-hashed username and password in a client-side cookie (via the `setcookie()` function), which is actually [not a good practice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17266448). If you can avoid it (and in most cases you really can) you shouldn't let user information like their password leave the server. All you need to have in a cookie is: \r\n- something to identify the user with (like their UID), \r\n- a 'remember me' token, \r\n- a *MAC* (message authentication code), which is generated server-side by using a hashing algorithm on the two components above. \r\n\r\nThe token is gonna be stored in the database mapped to the user ID. You can now use that cookie to check your database for the user via the ID and see if they have the respective 'remember me' token. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you are able to check if the cookie was generated on your server by comparing the MAC from the cookie with the result of running the same hashing algorithm on the user id and token that are in the cookie that the user sends and see if they are equal. There's [an answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1354999/keep-me-logged-in-the-best-approach/17266448#17266448) that demonstrate a way to implement this and also offers some exra context.\r\n\r\nAs for best practices and an additional security layer, you can also generate a new token each time the user loads the page and overwrite the old one in the cookie and in your database (as to keep it ever changing), so if a hacker gets hold of your cookie it's already invalid once you re-visit the page. \r\n\r\nWhen you follow this approach, you don't need to [add any more salt](https://excellium-services.com/2021/01/18/password-hashing-be-careful-about-what-you-hash/) to your cookie. By [hashing](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.hash-hmac.php) the unique identifier and the token with an sha256 algorithm – using some secret key that you have stored on your server, e.g. in an environment variable – and storing that in the cookie for comparing it later on with what your server yields, you are already on really safe terrain.",

(►\\_\\_◄) Or you can use some [tools to debloat Windows](./debloatingwindows).\r\n\r\n## Get detailed network configurations\r\n\r\nIn order to display IP address, subnet masks, default gateways and DNS server configs of your current network, just execute `ipconfig /all` or `Get-NetIPAddress`.\r\n\r\n## Mounting an .iso file\r\n\r\nIn order to create a virtual drive and mount an .iso image, use the following command:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nMount-DiskImage -ImagePath \"C:\\whatever.iso\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(For more information check the [Windows Powershell docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/blob/main/docset/winserver2022-ps/storage/Mount-DiskImage.md).)\r\n\r\n## Creating an empty file\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\necho $null \u003e\u003e config.ini\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Setting a environment variable\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=\"eu-central-1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using `.nvmrc` files\r\n\r\nIf you have `nvm` installed, in shells such as `zsh` or `bash` you can just run `nvm use` in order to switch to the node version specified in your `.nvmrc` file. With `nvm-windows` it's a little trickier. You will have to run the following command everytime before starting up your project in order to use the correct node version:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nnvm use $(Get-Content .nvmrc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut chances are that you will forget it sometime and use a wrong node version and wonder why your application doesn't work. Here is [a smart gist](https://gist.github.com/tcrammond/e52dfad4c2b36258f83f7a964af10097) with an alias for a script that works like `nvm use`. For more information, here is [the relevant Github issue](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/issues/128), which contains some more strategies to use `nvm use` on Windows and also an explanation why it will not be implemented as a native feature in `nvm-windows`.\r\n\r\nNote that, if you want to use `nvm-windows`, it is advisable to uninstall your current node.js installation and reinstall this one with `nvm` as well. Otherwise, Powershell might still use the version of `node` your environment variable points to instead of the one targeted with `nvm use`.\r\n\r\n## Escaping whitespaces in SCP\r\n\r\nIn order to copy folders with whitespaces in their names from my seedbox (Ubuntu) to my Laptop (Windows), I use this command:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nscp -r \"me@myseedbox:'/home/me/downloads/qbittorrent/Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani (2005)'\" C:\\Users\\Me\\Videos\\\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's several ways to escape whitespaces in Powershell and Linux shell of course, but this one is the only that worked for me when trying to copy from a Linux server to a Windows computer.\r\n\r\n## Copying files with SCP using a specific SSH key\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nscp -i \"C:/Users/Me/.ssh/LightsailDefaultKey-eu-central-1.pem\" -r \"C:/xampp/htdocs/sensape/wp-content/themes/*\" \"user@12.345.678.999:/home/user/stack/wordpress/wp-content/themes\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Creating an SSH tunnel\r\n\r\nIf you have a Bitname VM with a basic Wordpress installation, you will notice to for security reasons, you cannot access phpMyAdmin via `http://12.345.678.999/phpMyAdmin`, because this URL is only accessible using localhost (`127.0.0.1`) as the hostname. That means, you need to create an SSH tunnel, which will send requests to your server via localhost using our SSH key. In order to do so, run the following command:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nssh -N -L 8888:127.0.0.1:80 \"user@12.345.678.999\" -i \"C:/Users/Me/.ssh/LightsailDefaultKey-eu-central-  1.pem\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can begin the command with `ssh -f` to keep the tunnel running in the background, so even when you are closing your terminal it will still be active. In order to close it then, you need to find the process ID by running `ps` and looking for a process namend `ssh` and using its PID run `taskkill -pid \u003cPID\u003e\u003e /F`.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to SSH tunnels, you can also use a SSH jumphost:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nssh -J user@REMOTEMACHINE:22 -p 22 user@12.34.56.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n`REMOTEMACHINE` acts as a proxy here that forwards your request to `12.34.56.7`, which is another remote resource.\r\n\r\nSSH tunneling and jump hosts are explained visually in [this article](https://ittavern.com/visual-guide-to-ssh-tunneling-and-port-forwarding/).\r\n\r\n## `sudo` on Windows\r\n\r\nRunning commands as admin in the same terminal window on Windows is not as straight-forward as in the Linux/Unix OS family. There's [a tool called `gsudo`](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gsudo) which can be installed via chocolatey. In 2024 ›sudo for Windows‹ [was introduced](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows/).\r\n\r\n## Display Wi-Fi passwords\r\n\r\nIn order to display the Wi-Fi passwords you have saved on your computer, you first have to list all the saved connections with `netsh wlan show profiles` and look for the name of the connection you want the password of. Then type `netsh wlan show profile name=\"{NETWORK_NAME}\" key=clear` and it will display the password under `Key Content`.\r\n\r\n## Checking your DNS records\r\n\r\nWhen setting DNS records, you can check whether they have propagated by using `nslookup`. For example, for a TXT record, you'd write `nslookup -q=TXT _acme-challenge.example.de 8.8.8.8`, which should yield a result like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nServer:  dns.google\r\nAddress:  8.8.8.8\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\n_acme-challenge.example.de\r\ntext = \"12345_78-abcdefghijklmnopqr__stuvwxyZXYWVUT\"\r\n```\r\n",

One way to define what a column is, is by using the `-f` argument and cut by field. Fields are assumed to be tab-seperated, but you can specify the delimiter with the `-d` flag: `cut -d. -f1` will cut by `.`. The `-f` flag can take a number to specify which column to print; for the second, third and fourth column, we'd write `cut -f2,3,4` or `cut -f2-4`. With the `-c` flag we can cut columns by character count: `cut -c1-3`.\r\n\r\n## grep\r\n\r\n`grep` is used for searching and filtering strings based on an input string or regular expression. It actually stands for `global search for a regular expression and print out matched lines`. For inverse searching (filtering out the elements not containing some string, use the `-v` flag.)\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\n## epoll\r\n\r\n[epoll](https://darkcoding.net/software/epoll-the-api-that-powers-the-modern-internet/)\r\n\r\n# Pattern-matching and variables\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## Wildcards and globbing\r\n\r\nIn the Linux shell, the wildcard operator is `*`: `ls *.js` lists all javascript files. If you want a wildcard for only a single character, use `?`. Square brackets are used for matching characters from a list, so `ls *.[jt]s` would list all Javascript and Typescript files for example.\r\n\r\nIt's the shell, not the invoked program, that performs this pattern-matching. Therefore, different shells might treat your commands differently. While `echo *.js` in Linux shell will echo all files ending with `.js`, Windows Powershell will literally just echo ›\\*.js‹.\r\n\r\n## Environment variables\r\n\r\nYou can use `printenv` for printing environment variables: `printenv HOME`. When using these variables in a command you will have to put a `$` before: `cd $HOME`. The Linux shell will then resolve the variable. System-wide environment variables should usually be stored in `/etc/environment`.\r\n\r\n# Useful tools and combinations\r\n\r\n## Piping\r\n\r\nIn order to combine commands, you will use a pipe operator (`|`). When combinng two commands, the commands are usually not aware that they are part of the pipeline as they are just handling ›standard inputs‹ (`stdin`) and ›standard outputs‹ (`stdout`). (There's excepetions like `ls`.)\r\n\r\nSending output to a file can be done with `\u003e` (overwrites file) and `\u003e\u003e` (appends to file).\r\n\r\n## Show hidden characters\r\n\r\nFor debugging purposes it's sometimes useful to show all characters in a file, even those that are not printable. You can do the with `cat -v` followed by the filename, which show's the ASCII representation of non-printable characters.\r\n\r\nYou can also use `od` which displays the contents of an input file, too, but lets you specify the character format. So `od -c` prints the file content in character format (additionally it prints the byte offset at the beginning of each line that it outputs).\r\n\r\n## History expansion\r\n\r\nHistory expansion is done via excalamation marks (called ›bangs‹). `!!` executes the previous command again. In order to execute the third most recent command again, you would type `!-3`. `!cd` would execute the most recent command starting with `cd`, while `!?cd?` would execute the most recent command that had `cd` somewhere in it. With `!123` you can execute a command again based on its index in the history (as you can retrieve via `history` or by accessing `~/.bash_history`). If you only want to print the command from history, but not execute, add `:p` to the history expansion command: `!-5:p`. Though `echo \"!-5\"` would work as well. `!$` will retrieve the final word from your previous command, and `!*` will retrieve all arguments from your last command (unlike `!!`, which retrieves the program and its arguments). With `^` you can easily replace a string in your last command and execute it again. Let's say you mistyped a command: `mount /dev/s1 /media/hdd`. You can then correct it and execute it, by just typing `^s1^sda1`. Alternatively, you could write: `!!:s/s1/sda1/`\r\n\r\n## Mounting and unmounting\r\n\r\n`lstblk`\r\n\\\r\n-\u003e This will list all block devices and their partitions (you can also use `blkid` alternatively). After you have identified, for example, the HDD you just connected, you can mount it to a specific target with:\r\n\r\n`mount /dev/sda1 /media/myExternalHarddrive`\r\n\r\nUnmounting it is done via `umount /dev/sda1`\r\n\r\n## Syncing two folders\r\n\r\nBringing to folder in sync can be done with the `rsync` (remote sync) tool. I would usually run something like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrsync --stats --progress -aPv ~/media/Music someone@1.2.3.4:~/media/\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- ## `ed` and `sed`\r\n\r\n[...] --\u003e\r\n\r\n## Awk\r\n\r\n`Awk` is a scripting mostly used for data manipulation. It's syntax is such:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nawk options 'selection _criteria { action }' input-file \u003e output-file\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Awk` reads its input file line by line and each line is treated as a ›record‹.\r\n\r\n## Finding a running process\r\n\r\n`ps -ef | grep processname`\r\n\\\r\n-\u003e pipe `ps` into `grep`, i.e. list the currently running processes, send the list to `grep` which searches for lines containing the pattern `processname` (as regular expression)\r\n\r\n## Check size of folders\r\n\r\nTo check the size of the folders in the current folder (and excluding subfolders), run:\r\n\r\n`du -sh --max-depth=1 ./*/`\r\n\\\r\n(`-s` stands for summarize and `-h` for human-readable)\r\n\r\n## Directory stack\r\n\r\nYou can push directories to a stack and remove directories from them with `pushd` and `popd`, respectively, followed by the directory name, and you can view your directory stack with `dirs`. When you type `pushd` with no directory name it will swap the two top-most directories from your stack and take you to the new top directory. If you want to swap the top-most and the third directory and move to the latter, you can type `pushd +2`.\r\n\r\n## random snippets\r\n\r\n- in all of the current folder's subfolders and files, print the paths of those files and folders that contain the string ›ktl‹: `ls -d ./**/*  | grep -i 'ktl'`\r\n\r\n- find folders with the name ›needle‹ (case-insensitive) in all of the current folder's subfolders: `find ./ -type d -iname \"*needle*\" -print`\r\n\r\n- find the most common words in all .txt files that are at least two letters long and show their counts: `find ./ -name \"*.txt\" | xargs cat | egrep -o \"(\\w){2,}\" | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr | head`\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- - deflate a binary file: `printf \"\\x78\\x9c\" | cat - data.bin | zpipe -d | strings -el` ([source](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/hiew.html)) --\u003e\r\n\r\n## Books\r\n\r\n- Daniel J.

From my experience, using a CSS frameworks will enhance this process quite a bit as those often come with a lot of defaults that just work visually and allow you to focus on certain aspects of your designs.

    "content": "\r\n# Polylang language in REST API\r\n\r\nPolylang is a popular multilinguality plugin for WordPress. The pro version of it also provides some additional REST API endpoints. So in the regular version a request like the following will return all posts and just ignore the `lang` parameter:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nGET /wp/v2/posts?lang=en\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill, you can filter by language by adding a ustom REST field through your themes `functions.php`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nfunction my_theme_filter_rest_post_query( $args, $request ) {\r\n\t$lang_parameter = $request-\u003eget_param('lang');\r\n\r\n\tif ( isset( $lang_parameter ) ) {\r\n\t\t$args['lang'] = $lang_parameter; // https://polylang.pro/doc/developpers-how-to/#query\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn $args;\r\n}\r\nadd_filter( 'rest_post_query', 'my_theme_filter_rest_post_query', 10, 2 );\r\nadd_filter( 'rest_page_query', 'my_theme_filter_rest_post_query', 10, 2 );\r\n//add_filter( 'rest_{my_custom_posttype}_query', 'my_theme_filter_rest_post_query', 10, 2 ); // Custom posttype\r\n\r\nadd_action( 'rest_api_init', function () {\r\n\r\n\tregister_rest_field( 'post', 'language', my_theme_register_postlanguage_function() );\r\n\tregister_rest_field( 'page', 'language', my_theme_register_postlanguage_function() );\r\n\t//register_rest_field( '{my_custom_posttype}', 'language', my_theme_register_postlanguage_function() ); // Optional: Custom posttype\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction my_theme_register_postlanguage_function() {\r\n\treturn array(\r\n\t\t'methods'         =\u003e 'GET',\r\n\t\t'get_callback'    =\u003e 'my_theme_get_postlanguage_function',\r\n\t\t'schema'          =\u003e null,\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction my_theme_get_postlanguage_function( $data ) {\r\n\t$post_id = $data['id'];\r\n\treturn ( function_exists( 'pll_get_post_language' ) ? pll_get_post_language( $post_id ) : null );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_This code was originally written by [them-es](https://gist.github.com/them-es/3ab1aa674fdb1829a3079f09559c8614)._\r\n\r\n# ACF fields in REST API\r\n\r\nACF is another popular WordPress plugin for adding custom fields to WP posts and pages (you can add a short summary, social links etc. etc. for example). These fields are also not included in the standard WP REST API, even if in the ACF settings you activate `Show In REST API` in the respective field group (even though [according to the ACF documentation](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/wp-rest-api-integration/) it should).\r\n\r\nAgain, you can add a simple snippet to the `functions.php` file in order to retrieve the acf fields, too:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nfunction acf_to_rest_api($response, $post, $request) {\r\n    if (function_exists('get_fields') \u0026\u0026 isset($post-\u003eid)) {\r\n        $response-\u003edata['acf'] = get_fields($post-\u003eid);\r\n    }\r\n    return $response;\r\n}\r\nadd_filter('rest_prepare_post', 'acf_to_rest_api', 10, 3);\r\n```\r\n\r\n(_This code was taken from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57501896/20232056)._)\r\n\r\nTry `GET /wp/v2/posts` and every post should now have your custom fields from AC included.\r\n\r\n# Redirect frontend to elsewhere\r\n\r\nWhen using a headless WordPress setup, I ran into a situation where I wanted to have the WordPress admin section be served on `www.example.com/wp-admin`, but visitors should not be allowed to go see any WordPress frontend under `www.example.com`. Instead they should be redirected to the new frontend I host under `www.elpmaxe.com`. In order to do that I built a super minimal theme which only redirects frontend traffic and does nothing else (for which I used [this solution](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/17973)):\r\n\r\n- under `themes/`create a folder called `redirect`\r\n- add a `style.css` and an `index.php` to it\r\n- `style.css` should look like this:\r\n  ```php\r\n  /*\r\n     Theme Name: Redirect\r\n     Description: Redirects the front end to elpmaxe.com\r\n  */\r\n  ```\r\n- `style.css` should look like this:\r\n  ```php\r\n  \u003c?php\r\n       header( \"Location: https://www.elpmaxe.com\" );\r\n  ?\u003e\r\n  ```\r\n- activate the theme in the admin UI.\r\n\r\n# Add CORS header to MyCalender plugin\r\n\r\nMyCalendar is a WordPress plugin for creating calendars. Under 'Advanced Settings' you can activate exposing its API, which will let you fetch events from the calendar like that: `GET https://example.com?to=2024-06-25\u0026from=2024-05-26\u0026mc-api=json`. However, when working in a local development environment you might run into CORS issues, so you should\r\n\r\nBut you can add to following lines to the top of some file in your theme or plugins in order to allow fetching from everywhere:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nfunction add_cors_http_header(){\r\n    header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\");\r\n}\r\nadd_action('init','add_cors_http_header');\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added it to `/httpdocs/wp-content/plugins/my-calendar/my-calender.php` hoping that the CORS header will be scoped only to the MyCalendar routes, but I don't think that's the case. It's also not the best idea to add custom code in `plugins` files instead of `themes` files, because the code might get overwritten when updating the respective plugin.\r\n",

    "title": "SvelteKit: Using the YouTube iframe Player API",
    "content": "\r\nThe other day I tried to use YouTube iframe Player API in order to have a section of a YouTube video play in a loop on a\r\nwebsite I build. Usually I would just embed the video directly with the link and the parameters appended like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ciframe\r\n  width=\"1280\"\r\n  height=\"720\"\r\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdMG40wUCm4?autoplay=1\u0026loop=1\u0026autoplay=1\u0026playlist=kdMG40wUCm4\"\r\n  frameborder=\"0\"\r\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this won't let you loop only a portion of the video as it will always start the video at 0:00. In order to really have only a couple of seconds from the middle of a video play in a loop, you can't avoid the [YouTube iframe Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference). If you ever worked with that API you might have noticed that it's pretty outdated (pre-ES6 days) and not really made with modern frameworks in mind. So it took me a bit of tinkering around in order to translate the examples from the official YouTube docs to SvelteKit. But I eventually came up with a solution that worked.\r\n\r\nThe component looks as follows and you'll need to call it with the respective YoutTube video id as a prop; like so: `\u003cVideo id={'kdMG40wUCm4'} /\u003e`.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\timport { onMount } from 'svelte';\r\n\r\n\texport let id;\r\n\r\n    let player;\r\n\r\n\tonMount(() =\u003e {\r\n\t\tfunction onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {\r\n\t\t\tplayer = new YT.Player(id, {\r\n\t\t\t\t// width: 1280,\r\n\t\t\t\t// height: 720,\r\n\t\t\t\tvideoId: id,\r\n\t\t\t\tplayerVars: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstart: 50,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tend: 70,\r\n                    // Auto-play the video on load\r\n\t\t\t\t\tautoplay: 1,\r\n                    // Hide video controls when playing\r\n\t\t\t\t\tautohide: 1,\r\n                    // Hide pause/play buttons in player\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrols: 0,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdisablekb: 1,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tenablejsapi: 1,\r\n                    // Hide the full screen button\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfs: 0,\r\n                    // Run the video in a loop\r\n\t\t\t\t\tloop: 1,\r\n                    // Hide the Youtube Logo\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmodestbranding: 1,\r\n\t\t\t\t\trel: 0,\r\n                    // Hide the video title\r\n\t\t\t\t\tshowinfo: 0,\r\n                    // Hide closed captions\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcc_load_policy: 0,\r\n                    // Hide the Video Annotations\r\n\t\t\t\t\tiv_load_policy: 3\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tevents: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tonReady: onPlayerReady,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tonStateChange: onPlayerStateChange\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tonYouTubeIframeAPIReady();\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction onPlayerStateChange(state) {\r\n\t\t\tif (state.data === 0) {\r\n\t\t\t\tplayer.loadVideoById({\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvideoId: id,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstartSeconds: 50,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tendSeconds: 70\r\n\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction onPlayerReady(event) {\r\n\t\t\tplayer.seekTo(50);\r\n\t\t\tplayer.mute();\r\n\t\t\tplayer.playVideo();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003csvelte:head\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\u003c/svelte:head\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\r\n\t\u003cdiv id={id} /\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstyle lang='scss'\u003e\r\n\t.container {\r\n\t\t// use '*' instead of 'div',\r\n\t\t// because the onYouTubeIframeAPIReady function\r\n\t\t// will replace that 'div' with the 'iframe'\r\n\t\t\u003e*:first-child {\r\n\t\t\twidth: 300%;\r\n\t\t\tmargin-left: -100%;\r\n\t\t\theight: 100%;\r\n\t\t\tobject-position: center center;\r\n\t\t\tpointer-events: none; // prevent displaying video title etc. on hover\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\u003c/style\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThree things you should note here:\r\n\r\n- There's a bunch of [player parameters](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters.html?playerVersion=HTML5\u0026hl=de) you can set in order to hide video info, controls etc. from the video and have the video autostart on mute. Unfortunately, the `showinfo` parameter has been deprecated in 2018 (same as `rel`), so you'll always have the YouTube logo and the video title displayed, no matter what. There's a [little CSS hack by adamgreenough on Codepen](https://codepen.io/adamgreenough/pen/bGrgoNb) though that gets rid of the logo and the title. I utilized that in my example, along with setting `pointer-events` to `none` (so that hovering over the video won't trigger the video title being displayed either).\r\n- I use the `id` in order to identify the YouTube video I want to play, but also in order to reference the `div` which will be transformed into an `iframe` via the `new YT.Player(id)` instantiation. This allows me to use multiple videos in a page with the YouTube ID as the unique id. But you could also give the `div` a different id property and use that as parameter when instantiating the `YT.Player` object.\r\n- One thing I noticed is that the `YT.Player` object only gets instantiated on first mount. So when I navigate back and forth between routes, the second time I visit the route with the video, the player won't actually load. Thus, make sure to give the `container` element some background image, which will function as a fallback in case the video is not displaying.\r\n",
