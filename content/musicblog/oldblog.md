Woelv: Tout Seul dans la Forêt en Plein Jour, Avez-Vous Peur ?

<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M372pX0HEBM/V5NN9nl2X7I/AAAAAAAAAAM/72qG5D6xuSgsIBIdd8WJ8MxMOYm_tS-lACLcB/s1600/genevieve.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M372pX0HEBM/V5NN9nl2X7I/AAAAAAAAAAM/72qG5D6xuSgsIBIdd8WJ8MxMOYm_tS-lACLcB/s320/genevieve.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>

Here's a small reverence to the recently passed-away Geneviève Castrée. She drew comics and wrote music under the names Woelv and Ô Paon. She was the partner of Phil Elverum (of Mount Eerie, The Microphones), who collected money and donations to treat Castrée's cancer, but to no avail, eventually.  

»Tout Seul dans la Forêt en Plein Jour, Avez-Vous Peur ?« was recorded in 2005 and released 2007 on our all favourite record label K Records. 
I can't pin down who her voice reminds me of. Anyway, this here is a beautiful folk album sung in (Québécois) French—so you will probably not understand much, which is too bad, I suppose. But still, the instrumentation makes up for it. The progression of this album I found quite inventive and it has this breath of eerieness to it all the time.

You will be greatly missed.

Birchville Cat Motel: Chi Vampires (2004, Celebrate Psi Phenomenon)

...and here's an album by Campbell Kneale (cf. two post below)'s project Birchville Cat Motel. It has lots of high frequencies, some drones and then some more sludge-y moments. The instrumentation is very compelling. It sounds like there's an organ or a bagpipe playing at some points and I think I hear some field recordings. This is my verdict: It's very very very much good. Track 2 (»Buckling Metal Snowflakes«) rules supreme.

<br />
'90s instrumental, slightly Shellac-ish noise/math/post rock album featuring Jon Theodore, who would later play drums on the earlier The Mars Volta releases, on, probably, drums and, Phil Manley of Trans Am on I don't know what; doesn't really say.

On: On (2006, Celebrate Psi Phenomenon)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efY6b2goebo/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efY6b2goebo?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div>
<br />
There's only this one album by that band and an earlier demo tape as far as I know. I remember a time when music like this would've been given ephemeral descriptions such as »shitgaze«. Ultra-noisy garage-punk from Melbourne, mostly instrumental, occasional male-female vocals (very great!).
The record was out 2006 on (maybe Saucerlike Recordings, or maybe not, and on) the obviously great label Celebrate Psi Phenomenon—owned by Campbell Kneale, who also founded Battlecruiser and, moreover, plays in Black Boned Angel among other projects. Just starting to check out his stuff. Australian/New Zealandian noise rock I seem to know far too little here.

Pays Labë - Plaintes et Chants d'Amour

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tN-0Bb8U4XM/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tN-0Bb8U4XM?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div>
<br />
Need need need to share this and de-centralize it, just in case my hard-drive dies someday, or other horrible scenarios... <br />
These are polyphonic complaints and love songs from Labëria, Albania—usually sung by 2 or 3 voices. You may kiss your Turkish and Arabic dirges goodbye after hearing this.
The CD was released by the French label Oroca (founded by Pierre Schaeffer).

People: Misbegotten Man (2007, I And Ear Records)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVo9cuFRrgM/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVo9cuFRrgM?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div>
<br />

Untrained ears might think People's »Misbegotten Man« sounds like two incongruent recording tracks played at the same time—like, one mostly-melodic, at-times-experimental solo-guitar girl's bedroom recording plus a drum rehearsal edit by some guy trying to be Balázs Pándi or Paal Nilssen-Love or someone along those lines. The key here is to see the beauty and truthfulness of non-identity as we so often find it in this world, but ignore or discredit it due to the positivist stances we are taking, still, most of the time.

Supreme Dicks: The Emotional Plague (1996, Homestead Records)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k-gImaQt1dE/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-gImaQt1dE?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div>
<br />

The guitarist from my noise improvisation group wore a shirt of this band last week and I first mistook it for probably some pubertal band with a silly name that he played in when he was a teenager back then somewhere in the outskirts of Hamburg or thereabout.
But that is not the case, he corrected me. The Supreme Dicks were a lo-fi indie rock band from the States from the 90's who's lyrics are according to him somehow like gloomy lullabies or scary fairy tales. I for one really love it. Silver Jews—if you need a comparison—and then some.
»The Emotional Plague« (1996, Homestead Records) was their third and last album.

The Crainium: A New Music For A New Kitchen

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-DpQBDI7ks/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-DpQBDI7ks?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe>

<br />

This record's a manifesta!

"Multi-sex species". "A system of power over a system of death". "Yes. Yes. Yes. I Am A Traitor To My Sex!" "Make the domestic public!" "Our survival depends on our transformation in androgynous beings."

There's hardly anything comparable to The Crainium. The music is some sort of no-wave punk—like a strange mixture of Archbishop Kebab und (the) Daughters. While the lyrics directly, but in some bizarre way, address issues of gender equality and the like. Words don't do justice here. There's this central 8-minute track (not sure about the title since the tracks don't seem to be correctly tagged) that lays out the concept behind the album.

Quotes:
"With a new music we will break free from the body backwards."
"In a new kitchen we will dance on the symptoms."
"In a new kitchen, to the women, to the children, there are men looking up to them, listening and learning what feeling is and how to feel."

The band's comprised of members the later came to play in Gang Gang Dance and Blood Lines. But this won't give you any idea about what The Crainium sound like.

Units: Digital Stimulation

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OFcOQuilOPk/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFcOQuilOPk?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe>
This is the début album by a band called (the) Units from San Francisco - released in 1980. Kicking synthwavepostpunk. Think Devo, think the socialist cause, think a world without guitars!

Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company - 1970-73

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o7tI0qV1dkk/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7tI0qV1dkk?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe>

Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company were formed in 1969 by synthie master David Borden. If you like endlessly arpeggiating Moog sounds or minimal music like Terry Riley's or Steve Reich's vel c., this is for you! Listen to it for a few hours and you will walk on electric clouds. (Feels pretty good!)

Aihiyo (哀秘謡)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fxp-jLdhu2k/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxp-jLdhu2k?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div>
<br />

This is an album of cover songs of Japanese and non-Japanese songs from the 1950s and 60s by Keiji Haino whom you may know bands like Fushitsusha or Nazoranai, or from collaborating with a hell lot of great drone, avantgarde and free jazz artists, including Oren Ambarachi, Jim O'Rourke, Derek Bailey, Peter Brötzmann, etc. etc. Now, whom am I telling this? If you know any of them, you've probably heard of Keiji Haino, too. But maybe you haven't heard this thing. It's from 1998 and this cover project's called 哀秘謡 (Aihiyo).
So this there is a cover of The Zombies' »I Love You«. The instrumentation on the album is quite minimalistic—mostly just some somewhat dark and psychedlic guitar sounds with inexcessive use of effects and occasional drumming by Ikuro Takahashi. Keiji's vocals are quite insane.

[There's also a documentary film about Keiji called »Document: Keiji Haino« that I'm unable to find anywhere. Let us know, if you got any hints!]
