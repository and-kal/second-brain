Another rarity: A CDr by this Japanese plinky-guitar math-rock trio that the guys from [sajjanu](https://sajjanupechiku.wixsite.com/sajjanu) gave to me on their 2016 tour. I suppose these are three songs they'd been working on at that time, two of which ended up on their album [Third](https://gmftpo.bandcamp.com/album/third).
