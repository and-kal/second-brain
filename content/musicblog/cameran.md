I'm only a little ashamed to say that I was an avid [VISIONS](https://www.visions.de) reader in the 00's and was checking out everything that got good ratings and praise in there, which forced me to listen and try to like horrid bands like Manchester Orchestra or Attack In Black, but also sometimes had me stumble upon some more obscure bands, like this Austrian post-hardcore band. Okay, the vocals are hard to stomach, but it was the style of the time.
