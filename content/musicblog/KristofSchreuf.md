Here's two releases to lament the recent death of German "Diskursrock" weirdo Kristof Schreuf. Apart from his albums with kolossale Jugend, Schreuf also released one album with the band Br端llen and a solo record.

"Bourgeois With Guitar" contains mostly cover songs of evergreens you all know. It's a nice listen. But that Br端llen album is really where it's at. Even though Schreuf is mowing all over the intrumentation here, there's some really nice garage rock / post-punk riffs to spot. i remembered Schreuf's lyrics here as some neverending postmodern intellectual snarl, but listening to "Schatzitude" again I'm seeing them in a whole new light now. It seems, that Schreuf is just trying to describe the society he's living in and the things happening around him, be it in media, on the streets, or in his head and then put these thoughts and impressions in relation to each other. Things get really entangled there and it's hard to decipher all the lyrics and keep track of the common thread. But in a way, these lyrics seem very direct, not only for Schreuf's frentic delivery, but also because they're not concept art or avantgarde poetic strategies, but really just a lot of thoughts.
