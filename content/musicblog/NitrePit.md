Sole album by this band around Greg Saunier and Rob Fisk who later played in Deerhoof. Further members of Nitre Pit are Aaron Russell (The Weird Weeds) and Tasha Riggins. It's a self-released album and probably lots of parts seem improvised. The way the songs develop is pretty solid, though. I am always amazed by improvising band that still somehow manage to arrive and some sort of song-like structure (thinking of Cassiber or Storm & Stress). Also, "Lo!" has this 90's noise/post-rock feel to itâ€”think of bands like Unwound and you can definitely detect his Saunier's idiosyncratic drumming style on this one already.
