title: "The Doom Generation (1996)"

This was my first Greg Araki movie, so bear with me, if I'm stating the obvious here, but I found this one really campy. Not to the point that the film's unenjoyable. There's aspects of "The Doom Generation" I found very fresh and it's clearly a film that came from the heart of the director. [...] 
That being said though,

I thought #eventim had the de facto monopoly in event ticketing in Germany 'til I remembered that #ticketmaster also operates in Europe.

As illustrative and alarming as @zdfmagazin@edi.social's latest episode was, I guess they're not where one should stop critizing this economy.

I mean, which venue wants to resort to handling ticketing themselves again? I know there's mid-sized venues here in Leipzig, who are also forced to cooperate with #tixforgigs, despite their reservations towards them and their system of fees etc. That's because it'd too much extra work having to handle the ticketing themselves.

Luckily, there's still some small ticket sales points here, e.g. #CultonTicket. But apparently those are only practical for and known to people living here, not for people from other parts of Germany. The big companies still got much more reach and are convenient enough for customers. 

And then, who would want to start an ethical and fair ticketing company just for the sake of it. [...]

So I guess eventim, ticketmaster and the likes are here to stay.
