# The Doom Generation (1996)

This was my first Gregg Araki movie, so bear with me, if I'm stating the obvious here, but it's so campy. Not to the point that the film's unenjoyable. There's aspects of "The Doom Generation" I found very fresh and it's clearly a film that came from the heart of the director. [...]
That being said though, Rose McGowan

I thought #eventim had the de facto monopoly in event ticketing in Germany 'til I remembered that #ticketmaster also operates in Europe.

As illustrative and alarming as @zdfmagazin@edi.social's latest episode was, I guess they're not where one should stop critizing this economy.

I mean, which venue wants to resort to handling ticketing themselves again? I know there's mid-sized venues here in Leipzig, who are also forced to cooperate with #tixforgigs, despite their reservations towards them and their system of fees etc. That's because it'd too much extra work having to handle the ticketing themselves.

Luckily, there's still some small ticket sales points here, e.g. #CultonTicket. But apparently those are only practical for and known to people living here, not for people from other parts of Germany. The big companies still got much more reach and are convenient enough for customers.

And then, who would want to start an ethical and fair ticketing company just for the sake of it. [...]

So I guess eventim, ticketmaster and the likes are here to stay.

## title: "The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe Who Lived for Twenty and Eight Years All Alone on an Inhabited Island and Said It Was His (2023)"

One of those movies that left me unimpressed while watching, but which I ended up sort of liking after the Q&A with the director. Benjamin Deboosere retells the story of Robinson Crusoe and turns everything which makes the original book so excruciating on its head, bringing out the colonialist phantasies and ludicrous romances of adventure of the original in all its ridiculousness. Not knowing the book though, I didn't always knew what I was actually watching and how the parts connect and also sometimes didn't know why I'm actually watching it right now. That is, I still don't understand the narrative value of some chapters—such as the one with Gio, the goat (even though that chapter was quite cute). But anyway, the movie has enough visual ideas and beautiful sets and costumes and generally a nice look to it to keep it entertaining, even when I expected a bit more excitement, for example because the opening credits stated that the cannibals in the movie will be portrayed by a queer dance company, if I remember correctly. But the actual dance scene wasn't particularly impressive and made me realize that a little more energy and verve and perhaps a proper musical film interlude here and there wouldn't have done the film any harm, as it was a bit of an understatement.

Perhaps it was part of Benjamin Deboosere's plan to take up various well-known chapters from the book in the movie and since the book is—according to Deboosere—extremely bad and boring, it was obviously not possible to redeem every chapter of the original book from the its boredom or predictability by means of beautiful images, narrative changes and cool actors\*.
