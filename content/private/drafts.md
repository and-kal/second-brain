# The Doom Generation (1996)

This was my first Greg Araki movie, so bear with me, if I'm stating the obvious here, but I found this one really campy. Not to the point that the film's unenjoyable. There's aspects of "The Doom Generation" I found very fresh and it's clearly a film that came from the heart of the director. [...]
That being said though,

# Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani

It's great. I mean, it's okay. Like, it's corny and kind of stupid, but it has some cool shots. I wish I could like this movie more. There's a lot of stuff in this film I have never seen on the big screen before: First and foremost, the ear-splitting free improv guitar noise solo, which marks the climax of the film. But also audio recording software (Avid ProTools in this case) in action, the sound of self-built sound generators paired with shots of Japanese landscape. Stuff like that. And I appreciate the movie for these things and how it puts the sonic practice of Nakahara and Asano into its center. I also wouldn't have mind the somewhat contrived and shallow story so much. Or the clichéd and shallown other characters in this movie. Maybe not even the additional score of the movie, which is mostly trivial piano music and saxophone moanings. Or how inchoate the dialogues are and how the movie is of course quite male gaze-y. (Though those two things get very annoying.)

I could go along with a lot of this, because it's still a nice watch—pleasantly slow-paced, beautifully photographed. But in sum, everything in the movie that is not about making noise and exploring sounds, unfortunately, feels bland and empty and left me clueless what the whole story is actually about. Which is a shame, because as Aoyama proved with »Eureka«, he's actually capable of telling a story with depth. But in »Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani« it's hard to make any connection with the characters, and whatever the movie was trying to communicate—apparently it's supposed to be a story about suicide, despair and hope, trauma and retraumatization—won't reach the audience. Actually, up until some point the film gave off the impression that the story really is kind of secondary and not the main focus here—just like that whole pandemic thing was only the second news item in the radio. But then the epilogue sets in and it is so hardcore cheesy and trying hard to evoke big emotions that it's funny. The scene in the bar where Miyagi and Navi sit together and Miyagi articulates how God has forsaken him; the inner monologue of Hana (something about hope and some loved one and how Winter is about to come), which was totally uncalled-for and didn't add up at all; the oscillating between melancholic and feel-good vibes.

It's a shame, because if the storytelling wasn't so ridiculous, this movie could have a been a really unique experience. And in parts it is. But given that the story and the characters aren't very formed, it's hard to immerse in it. Still, I wouldn't discourage anyone from watching it. A lot of scenes are memorable and impressive. Also it gave me an itch to listen to some Merzbow or Jim O'Rourke or even Nakahara's project Violent Onsengeisha again.

I thought #eventim had the de facto monopoly in event ticketing in Germany 'til I remembered that #ticketmaster also operates in Europe.

As illustrative and alarming as @zdfmagazin@edi.social's latest episode was, I guess they're not where one should stop critizing this economy.

I mean, which venue wants to resort to handling ticketing themselves again? I know there's mid-sized venues here in Leipzig, who are also forced to cooperate with #tixforgigs, despite their reservations towards them and their system of fees etc. That's because it'd too much extra work having to handle the ticketing themselves.

Luckily, there's still some small ticket sales points here, e.g. #CultonTicket. But apparently those are only practical for and known to people living here, not for people from other parts of Germany. The big companies still got much more reach and are convenient enough for customers.

And then, who would want to start an ethical and fair ticketing company just for the sake of it. [...]

So I guess eventim, ticketmaster and the likes are here to stay.

## title: "The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe Who Lived for Twenty and Eight Years All Alone on an Inhabited Island and Said It Was His (2023)"

Einer dieser Art Filme, die mich beim Zuschauen unbeeindruckt ließen, aber die ich nach dem Q&A dann doch gut fand. Benjamin Deboosere erzählt die Geschichte von Robinson Crusoe neu und stellt alles, was das ursprüngliche Buch so schlecht macht, auf den Kopf und bringt so die Kolonialismus- und Abenteuerromantik des Orginals in ihrer Lächerlichkeit zum Vorschein. Ich wusste zwar während des Schauens nicht immer, was ich mir da grade eigentlich ansehe und wozu. Aber der Film hatte doch genügend visuelle Ideen und eine schöne Optik, die mich bei der Stange hielten. Den erzählerischen Wert mancher Kapitel (wie etwa das mit Gio, der Ziege) habe ich dennoch nicht verstanden (auch wenn besagter Akt ganz süß war).

Möglicherweise war es Teil von Benjamin Debooseres Plan, diverse bekannte Kapitel aus dem Buch in dem Film aufzugreifen und da das Buch seinen Aussagen nach extrem schlecht und langweilig ist, konnte offenbar nicht jedes Kapitel durch schöne Bilder, erzählerische Verfremdungen und coole Schauspieler*innen vor der Langweiligkeit oder Vorhersehbarkeit des ursprünglichen Buches gerettet werden. Ich habe aber auch etwas mehr erwartet als im Vorspann zu lesen war, dass die Kannibalen-Darsteller*innen im Film von einer dargestellt werden. Die tatsächliche Tanzszene war dan naber nicht sonderlich eindrücklich und hat mich merken lassen, dass ein bisschen mehr Energie und vielleicht eine Musical-Einlage dem Film nicht geschadet hätte.

Dennoch hatte ich im Anschluss an das Q&A doch Respekt für den Film, da mir das kolonialismus-kritische und aufklärerische Anliegen des Films bewusster wurde. Also, first time I got fooled into believing I'm actually watching a film shot on analog film, but in fact it's all just filters (expcept the first few minutes).
