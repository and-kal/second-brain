This is a German hiphop tape I got from a guy I sold an 1998 Roland SP-808 to. The guy's [Lause Bub Beats](https://soundcloud.com/lause_bub_bea) on Soundcloud and he's doing boom bap beats. Super hardcore into old samplers to flip stuff from vinyls. Apaarently, he's released a number of tapes already, but only in very small editions that were distributed among friends, which is also why there is really no information on this release online.
