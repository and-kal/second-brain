This is a rip of a German hiphop tape I got from a guy I sold an 1998 Roland SP-808 to some weeks ago. The guy's [Lause Bub Beats](https://soundcloud.com/lause_bub_bea) on Soundcloud and he's doing mostly boom bap beats. Super friendly guy from a some small East German town; hardcore into old school sampling hardware to flip stuff from vinyl. Apparently, he's released a number of tapes already, but only in very small editions that were distributed among friends, which is also why there is really no information on this release online.
