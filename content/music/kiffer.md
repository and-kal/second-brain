This is a rip of a German hiphop tape I got from someone I sold an 1998 Roland SP-808 to a year ago. The guy's [Lause Bub Beats](https://soundcloud.com/lause_bub_bea) on Soundcloud and he's doing mostly boom bap beats. Super friendly dude from some small East German town; hardcore into old school sampling hardware to flip stuff from vinyl. Apparently, he's released a number of tapes already, but only in very small editions that were distributed among friends, which is also why there is really no information on this release online.

Beats were done mostly by [Grammophon Finest](https://soundcloud.com/alkoholika-prozenta), on whose Youtube channel there is also some music videos and [a teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMPCwjChCLg) for this EP from eleven years ago (2014). So I guess they recorded this tape around then. 

Smooth, nicely saturated boom bap beats with mostly battle rap lyrics on top of it and funny German movie samples in between.

Tape was ripped using an Onkyo TA-2430 stereo out to Zoom UA-24 stereo in (run via ASIO on 44.1 kHz audio)
recorded and normalized in Ableton 11 and rendered as 44.1 kHz WAV.
De-noised using Izotope RX and again rendered to 44.1 kHz WAV.
Converted from WAV to 44.1kHz-16bit FLAC with Audacity. 
I couldn't always tell where one track ends and the next one begins, so I decided to leave each side of the tape as one file.
