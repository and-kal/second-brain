[...] Just revisited this band after going through my vinyls and I remember them as a pretty impressive, sporty live band. Totally bonkers math rock stuff from UK. Not unlike Cap'n Jazz at times.

Gotta admit, that I don't love »Theme From Kindness« so much. It's a bit a bit of a messy listen. Though I appreciate the fact that they put harmonica musings and jammy outtakes, for me they're mostly just little breaks before the next blast of the mathy goodness comes. The guitar and bass melodies are really inventive and sometimes even beautiful and the drumming is stirring, too. Also these songs - like _Pneulope_ or _Robinson Crusoe_ - don't come off as too technical and contrived as with other math rock bands from that time, but instead they have an organic, rehearsal space-y vibe to them.

Pretty surprised they only got a handful of reviews on Bandcamp as of now.

Last I heard was that they're guitarsist Stef Ketteringham is doing solo stuff. All of his and they're stuff is up on the [Romac Puncture Repairs Bandcamp page](https://romacpuncturerepairs.bandcamp.com).
