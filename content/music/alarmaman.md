Very great car-chase scene type instrumental math-rock from the glory days of [Sinnbus Records](http://sinnbus.de), before it went from being a label with a very unique early post-rock like signature sound to a label for soft indiepop (though I appreciate their latest additions, gotta say: [Eilis Frawley](https://eilisfrawleydrums.bandcamp.com/) and
[Painting](https://paintingband.bandcamp.com/)).

[Alarma Man: Alarma Man](https://mega.nz/file/ZNA2QJiQ#vnZeMBGXnpPAXJf6-ger5NJ26iBZM-wPXkDb4RTsUJM) (Sinnbus, 2004) [.flac]
