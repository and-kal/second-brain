Here's the first release of Dresden's Zappa-ist math-rock outfit Schnaak. Johannes DÃ¶pping on drums, Mathias JÃ¤hnig on guitar and electronics. This one was released on a mini-CDr and I bought it at a show back then. They were great! I remember the guitar having an extra bass string on it for low-ends and the drummer used some besom for drumming at some point. 

Was a good time for weird math-y music around 2010 - with local labels like Discorporate Records, I Love Marbach Records, and Urquinaona Records. Well, they just don't make this sort of music anymore these days. ðŸ‘´ (Except for don vito who still play shows every now and then.)
