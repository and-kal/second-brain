Loved this album quite a bit on my emo hayday. It hasn't aged as well as other classics such as Cap'n Jazz, but I can still see what I loved about it. It's a really energetic and has a lot of sweet songwriting ideas in it. Good vibes. Just as the riffs, the vocals are a little over the top. I wasn't surprised at all, when I double-checked, if the singer looks like the gruffy, beardy, but still somewhat silky Nick Offermann type of guy I imagined him to be. I like this kind of exaltated vocals in At The Drive-In and they still feel alright.

My favourite songs on here are actually the less rocking-out ones, like _MPS_ or _Bloodgiver_.
