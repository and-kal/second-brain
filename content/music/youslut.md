A backlog from the glorious mid-00s last.fm days when you'd stumble across some obscure band on there by accident because some user in the This Town Needs Guns shoutbox mentioned their name and you became totally obsessed with the band. (And then you find other bands again in You Slut!'s shoutbox that are even more obscure and one of their members also has a last.fm account, so you ask him for some MP3s of his band, because there's no Bandcamp yet or anything. Good times.) 

Listening to the album again now, I realize that it's strangely pieced together and sometimes it's all a bit too unprecedented and the many parts aren't always sewn together coherently. Nevertheless, it's great fun how something new happens every four bars and how almost Djent-like parts alternate with Cap'n Jazz-like shimmer and blink guitars, then Shellac-like bass runs come in, etc etc. I still love that stuff - even if the band name is a bit cringeworthy, I admit.
