## Are NFTs the new Slayer backpatch?

I find some of the prophecies from the web3 community really hilarious. One of my favourites was in an article titled [https://musicx.mirror.xyz/r7kU3Ssy-MldqOOyEJN6f0vqYrB7OJDV6LJCy41EA8k](NFT Avatars and Onboarding Subcultures to the Web3) on the _Music ✘_ newsletter. (Money quote: "I don’t know about you, but I’m so ready for crypto goth, crypto gabber, and actual crypto punk.") Sure enough, subcultures and youth cultures already aren't as localized anymore as they used to be (Bodo Mrozek wrote about these trends in "Jugend – Pop – Kultur. Eine transnationale Geschichte") and much more mediated through the internet. There's some sort of new youth cultures and subcultures forming already through the dynamics of the popular social media platforms, though they are more like microcultures (equivalent to microgenres as you find them on SoundCloud).

[...]

But the way Bas Grasmayer is romanticizing the idea of eventual web3 subcultures seems misguided. Just as in the currently popular social online spaces, there's aesthetics, trends, and ideas forming that groups of people adopt and these sort of dynamics can be seen as part-and-parcel to the emergence of actual subcultures. But there's some more requirements to be met. Perhaps I underestimate the idea of the metaverse, but I don't think that a bunch of digital assets will have the driving force needed to initiate a subcultural movement. Because one integral part to subcultures is the political aspect of it.

Going crypto and stuff can also be a political move for some people and the political convictions implicit there (becoming independent from the big platforms, ...) can have a binging and uniting force. However, I don't see yet how the web3 space will be able to channel these political drives of a community. Much because I don't get the impression that the models these Crypto Punk people have for their web3 spaces aren't really that much about communication.
