Sweet, loop-based analog ambient. Lots of crackles and humming, stirring vocal sample fragments, repetitive guitar pluckings. Restrained, but gripping night-time music. Reminiscent a bit of [And the Black Moths Play the Grand Cinema](https://staubgold.bandcamp.com/album/and-the-black-moths-play-the-grand-cinema) and [Common Era](https://belong.bandcamp.com/album/common-era).
