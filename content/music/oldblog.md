## Woelv: Tout Seul dans la Forêt en Plein Jour, Avez-Vous Peur ? (K Records, 2007)

<br />

Here's a small reverence to the late Geneviève Castrée. She drew comics and wrote music under the names Woelv and Ô Paon, was the partner of Phil Elverum (of Mount Eerie, The Microphones), who collected money and donations to treat Castrée's cancer.

»Tout Seul dans la Forêt en Plein Jour, Avez-Vous Peur ?« was recorded in 2005 and released 2007 on K Records.

I can't pin down who her voice reminds me of. It's a beautiful folk album sung in (Québécois) FrenchBut still, the instrumentation makes up for it. The progression of this album I found quite inventive and it has this breath of eerieness to it.

## Birchville Cat Motel: Chi Vampires (Celebrate Psi Phenomenon, 2004)

An album by Campbell Kneale's project Birchville Cat Motel. It has lots of high frequencies, some drones and then some more sludge-y moments. The instrumentation I found very compelling. It sounds like there's an organ or a bagpipe playing at some points and I think I hear some field recordings. Track 2 (»Buckling Metal Snowflakes«) rules supreme.

## Golden: Golden (Trans Solar Syndicate. 1998)

<br />

'90s instrumental, slightly Shellac-ish noise/math/post rock album featuring Jon Theodore, who would later play drums on the earlier The Mars Volta releases and Phil Manley of Trans Am on I don't know what instrument - doesn't really say.

## On: On (Celebrate Psi Phenomenon, 2006)

<br />

There's only this one album by that band and an earlier demo tape as far as I know. Ultra-noisy garage-punk from Melbourne, mostly instrumental, occasional male-female vocals, which are very great. This might have been called »shitgaze« back then.

The record was out 2006 on Saucerlike Recordings and the obviously great Celebrate Psi Phenomenon—owned by Campbell Kneale, who also founded Battlecruiser and plays in Black Boned Angel among other projects. Just starting to check out that Australian/New Zealandian noise rock stuff.

## Pays Labë - Plaintes et Chants d'Amour (Oroca, 2004)

<br />
Need to share this and de-centralize it, just in case my hard-drive dies someday. It's so beautiful. These are polyphonic complaints and love songs from Labëria, Albania—usually sung by 2 or more voices. The CD was released by the French label Oroca (founded by Pierre Schaeffer).

## People: Misbegotten Man (I And Ear Records, 2007)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVo9cuFRrgM/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVo9cuFRrgM?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div>
<br />

Untrained ears might think People's »Misbegotten Man« sounds like two incongruent recording tracks played at the same time—one mostly melodic, at times experimental solo-guitar bedroom recording plus a drum rehearsal edit by some guy trying to do Balázs Pándi or Paal Nilssen-Love stuff. The key to the art is to see the beauty and truthfulness of non-identity so often traceable it in this world, but ignored or discredited due to the positivist stances we are taking most of the time.

## Supreme Dicks: The Emotional Plague (Homestead Records, 1996)

<br />

One guitarist from my noise improvisation group wore a shirt of this band last week and I first thought it must be some pubertal band with a silly name that he played in when he was a teenager back then somewhere in the outskirts of Hamburg.
But that is not the case, as he corrected me. The Supreme Dicks were a 90's lo-fi indie rock band from the States who's lyrics are like gloomy lullabies or scary fairy tales, according to him. I really love this one. If you need a comparison:it's a little like Silver Jews.

»The Emotional Plague« was their third and last album.

## James Plotkin & Paal Nilssen-Love: Death Rattle

Spreading some more (P. N.-)Love!
This time combined with guitar improvisations by the overall great James Plotkin (Khanate, Old Lady Drivers, Scorn, Phantomsmasher).<br />

## The Crainium: A New Music For A New Kitchen

<br />

This record's a manifesta!

"Multi-sex species". "A system of power over a system of death". "Yes. Yes. Yes. I Am A Traitor To My Sex!" "Make the domestic public!" "Our survival depends on our transformation in androgynous beings."

There's hardly anything comparable to The Crainium. The music is some sort of no-wave punk mixed with Archbishop Kebab. While the lyrics directly, but in some bizarre way, address issues of gender equality and the like. There's this central 8-minute track (not sure about the title since the tracks don't seem to be correctly tagged) that lays out the concept behind the album.

Quotes:
"With a new music we will break free from the body backwards."
"In a new kitchen we will dance on the symptoms."
"In a new kitchen, to the women, to the children, there are men looking up to them, listening and learning what feeling is and how to feel."

The band's comprised of members the later came to play in Gang Gang Dance and Blood Lines. But this won't give you any idea about what The Crainium sound like.

## Units: Digital Stimulation

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OFcOQuilOPk/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFcOQuilOPk?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe>

This is the début album by a band called (the) Units from San Francisco - released in 1980. Kicking, synth-ladden new- wave post-punk. Think Devo. Think the socialist cause. Think a world without guitars.

## Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company - 1970-73

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o7tI0qV1dkk/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7tI0qV1dkk?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe>

Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company were formed in 1969 by synth maestro David Borden. If you like endlessly arpeggiating Moog sounds or minimal music like Terry Riley's or Steve Reich's vel c., this one's definitely for you! Listen to it for a few hours and you will tart to walk on electric clouds.

## Aihiyo (哀秘謡)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fxp-jLdhu2k/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxp-jLdhu2k?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div>
<br />

This is an album of cover songs of Japanese and non-Japanese songs from the 1950s and 60s by Keiji Haino whom you may know bands like Fushitsusha or Nazoranai, or from collaborating with lots of great drone, avantgarde and free jazz artists, like Oren Ambarachi, Jim O'Rourke, Derek Bailey, Peter Brötzmann, etc. If you know any of them, you've probably heard of Keiji Haino, too. But maybe you haven't heard this thing. It's from 1998 and the project's called 哀秘謡 (Aihiyo).
There is a cover of The Zombies' »I Love You«. The instrumentation on the album is quite minimalistic—mostly just some somewhat dark and psychedlic guitar sounds with inexcessive use of effects and occasional drumming by Ikuro Takahashi. Keiji's vocals are quite insane.

There's also a documentary film about Keiji called »Document: Keiji Haino« that I'm unable to find anywhere. (I found a rip of the accompanying soundtrack CD by Fushitsusha though.) That film just doesn't seem to exist digitally. Let me know, if you got any hints!
