Kind of a hefty question. So here's some ideas I gathered.

[According to Aella](https://aella.substack.com/p/what-a-woman-is) ([after Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBw8dDkAWohFjWQSk/the-cluster-structure-of-thingspace)), »[Some] [c]oncepts [...] are not discrete points, they're clusters - collections of a bunch of traits that seem to reappear as a pattern. We can make a giant list of thousands of things that describe ›cat‹ [...] Asking ›which of the list of a thousand items makes a cat truly a cat?‹ is nonsensical. Some are more unique to cat-cluster-lists than other lists, but no single entry is the truth.« 

How individual are the thresholds of when you count something as falling under this category and not the other.
