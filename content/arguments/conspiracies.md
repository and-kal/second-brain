# Arguing with conspiracy theorists 

What's the person's motivation behind their beliefs

## Reptiloids

The "Reptilian conspiracy theory" is an unparsimonious theory and introduces a certain complexity to describing the world we live in that excesses a necessary description.

Theories like these introduce a big amount of categories in need of explanation and justification. 
Since we don't have any knowledge of other intelligent life forms outside of planet Earth, we'd need an explanation for Reptiloids existence, for why they're mental structures, language, etc. are compatible with ours and why they are phenotypically related to Earth's reptile lifeforms.
