Upon reading Stephen Diehl's [https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/crypto-is-a-scam.html](Yes, Crypto is ALL a Scam) article recently, I was wondering what makes believing in certain things like data privacy or nature conservation different from believing other things, such as the existence of God or homeopathy, and why people that go "crypto-pilled" would fall into the second category rather than the first.

The obvious answer would be that the latter are likely to be wrong, while the former sort of have a point. As Diehl points out, "faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen"
