And it wasn't a great watch. ( >︹<)

Visually, the movie looks like a parody of this kind of documentary; something that *Saturday Night Live* or *Tim & Eric* might pull off. 

During the course of the whole movie one gets the impression that Matt Walsh isn't at all interested in having a conversation or learning from other people, but actually just wants someone 

The only moments where Walsh doesn't look like some [little expressionless animal](https://machines.kfitz.info/dfwwiki/index.php%3Ftitle=Little_Expressionless_Animals.html) while his interviewee talks is when it's people who are confirming his beliefs and convictions, like his transgender opponent allies.

It feels cumbersome to even criticize the ways in which Walsh tries to manipulate his viewers. Like when he asks a gender studies professor what is sex and gender and the time lapses the interviewee's response so as to point out how ridiculously long his answer is. 

There's a few bits in »What Is A Woman?« where Walsh – I suppose unknowingly – debunks himself. For example, he frequently gets asked why he's so interested in that question and is go-to answer is that he just wants to know about reality as in the truth out there in the physical world. [...]

There's also this unbearable sequence where Matt Walsh visits a group of Massai people in Kenya and asks them (via a translator) about gender roles and identity. I don't even know if these terms translate to Maa language, but he does get some answers from the Massai people along the lines of ›women have these roles in society and men those; men have these genitalia and women those‹. Well, what other answer would you expect? His whole point of travelling to Kenya seems to be to show that all the talk about self-assigned or non-binary gender is only a Western phenomenon. [...]

Walsh also debunks himself during the interview with local politican [...] who calls him out for jumping straight to ›the restroom discussion,‹ when the intereview takes place under the pretense of being a discussion or inverview about transgenderism. [...]

Walsh actually has an answer to the question his film poses and it's surprisingly vague: [...]

At the time of writing »What Is A Woman?« holds an IMDB rating of 8.4/10. Given that the film is really poorly made, that's an astonishing score; put aside the reactionary ideas this film promotes and you still can't actually say that this film is ›a great documentary‹ (that deserves the same score as say, Elem Klimov's »Idi i smotri« (also 8.4 avg.)) given how trashy and corny »What Is A Woman?« is. So my guess is that the people who give this flick such high ratings are just men who see their prior beliefs verified by this movie. It's not like this movie is teaching you anything.
