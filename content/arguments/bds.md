In [The Wire 495](https://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/495) there's a list of Palestine solidarity compilations. While I appreciate the effort to present fundraising initiatives potentially helping people in Palestine I was also exasperated to see that they also included a compilation called »BDS Mixtape«. Do artists always have to come back to this organization? There's enough proof of their ties to terrorist organizations by now. Last month's Boiler Room editorial was mad, too, where they stated, »We continue to adhere to BDS and PACBI guidelines regarding artist programming and brand partnerships and engage with Palestinian artists and organisers in order to formalise our internal policies in line with this commitment.« Is BDS giving out the guidelines now that festivals and agencies have to follow? Why do they have to pledge allegiance to these madmen at BDS instead to try to come up with a standpoint and curatorial/political practice of their own.
