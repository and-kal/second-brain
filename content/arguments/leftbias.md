> But in the meantime, even if it is achieved eventually, why is it so difficult to make Grok right-wing? The short answer is that the words it is trained on do not support that, because most written text, especially that available on the internet is produced by the left-wing people.

Part of what it means to be powerful is the capacity to fulfill one’s own desires. 3. So, from a preference utilitarian perspective, we have good prima facie reasons to favour the unfulfilled desires of the weak.4. Therefore, from a preference utilitarian perspective, there are good prima facie reasons to think that the left is more correct than the right, because, and insofar as it favours the weak.

> There are strong prima facie reasons to think that the interests of a group are best served by the policies of those who value that group and its equality, not those who think it should be subservient to others. There is thus a path to leftwing reliability, and rightwing anti-reliability on these issues, although it is not certain [...] ([Philosophy Bear](https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/why-the-left-is-right))
