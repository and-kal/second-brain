> But in the meantime, even if it is achieved eventually, why is it so difficult to make Grok right-wing? The short answer is that the words it is trained on do not support that, because most written text, especially that available on the internet is produced by the left-wing people. The deeper point is that by its nature, writing, especially writing that survives, tends to embody progressive values. Universal, empathetic, emotionally thoughtful, curious, and open, all this is true even when we factor in the numerous exclusions on who gets to write. The written word aims at the reconciliation of all things, Apocatastasis. ([Philosophy bear](https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/grokking-the-logos))

This aligns with my belief that leftist thinking is built more on the assumption that the world is logically structured and that we move in a space of reasons. On the other hand, passionate conspiracy theorists, such as flat-earthers, are known for building up a lot of theory, resoning and argumentation. However, it seems to me that the underlying logical structure is often disregarded and that their prior beliefs and axioms are arbitrary.

This is also consistent with the statistic that fake news and sensationalist, rather than analytical, news is particularly prevalent in right-wing media.
