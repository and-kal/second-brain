...give these two dumb fucks any more attention than they deserve (which would be none). But I just had a little intuition when I was thinking about the conversation (or whatever it was) that they had yesterday: Namely, that making stupid and ludicrous claims doesn't necessarily expose yourself and earn you a bad reputation, but rather results in the discourse in general becoming increasingly stupid and regressive, so that we fall further and further behind our argumentative achievements. Now some Karlheinz will soon come around the corner and start discussing the fact that Weidel is actually right with her stupid ranting and the nazis were actually socialists, because, you see, that's already in the name ›nationalsocialists‹.

Sure, we can start discussing these kinds of ideas now and exchange our definitions. But if that's their idea of free speech, then keep the ›censorship‹ and content moderation coming, because I don't want to have the same discussions again that I used to have with some young growing-up-to-be-fascists guys in school, when I was 15 or something.
