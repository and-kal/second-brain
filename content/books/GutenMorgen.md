If you thought this was a book about romance scamming because it has been widely publicized, you will be disappointed. At least there is no in-depth examination of this vile act of exploiting the trust and neediness of others. The main character actually writes with just one love scammer, which develops into a private chat between the two. The author uses this chat-like communication to address topics such as the responsibility of the Western world towards the Third World, but also as a narrative device to reveal certain thoughts and predicaments of her (autobiographical) main character. [...]

Also, the fact that all the characters in the book are named after Roman and Greek deities seems to me like a cheap trick that has often been tried to give the characters more depth by adding the possibility of associating the characters with the attributes that come with these ancient gods - a depth that the characters don't have. Moreover, even Hefter's neighbor gets a Roman goddess name, even though she is only an extra in the book and has no personality at all.

I can appreciate the attempt to draw a contemporary picture of interpersonal communication, including emojis. However, the printed chat histories are

I can find all this quite good so far. But I can also find it extremely simple-minded and largely uninteresting.

It's all well and good to choose certain leitmotifs for a novel. However, this often makes the novel feel very redundant, for example when the author explains to us several times that the theater stage is real life for her, where she feels alive and can be everything she can't be in everyday life. In fact, this introspection is already hackneyed the first time and doesn't get any better with repetition. I also don't find it very successful that Lars von Trier's ‘Melancholia’, of all films, has to be used again and again to illuminate the inner life of the main character. Of course, the idea of the end of the world exerts a tremendous fascination on us. [...]

Actually, I don't want to be polemical, because I find Hefter's female speaker position exciting. Because even though I follow a lot of female authors, the reality of life for women in their mid-50s is very unfamiliar to me and, in a way, this cohort is also somewhat invisible. Hefter describes, for example, how it would feel for her to go to a club or what it was like for her to get a tattoo at her age, what it's like to get date requests on Instagram, etc. However, Hefter stays too much on the surface here. [...]

The literary trick of breaking out of the narrator's perspective in the middle and pointing out to the reader that Juno is actually Hefter herself (which is actually pretty clear from the start and no surprise at all) and that she only uses the romance scammer Benu as a reason to write, i.e. to have a reason to write and at the same time an addressee for her writing. It all feels very writing workshop-like in the book and more like a writing exercise than writing a novel. [...]

What [other authors](./bradshawvariations) succeed in doing convincingly, namely, starting from the description of everyday episodes to work out general, sometimes universal human feelings, worries, views of the world and ways of living together, Hefter fails magnificently. When Hefter writes about everyday things, she does not succeed in establishing a relatable access to the inner world of her characters [...]; instead, Hefter simply has a tendency to artificially charge things. Sometimes Hefter succeeds in charging things with meaning and existential content - for example in the occasional descriptions of nature or [...] - but too often she does not. Although Juno's multiple burdens (sick husband, little income, being a woman, etc.) are also a recurring topos in the book and these are also things worth writing a book about, Hefter's writing often remains in the realm of the trivial and we watch the main character preparing reports for a cultural promotion program ready for the post office and knocking over her coffee in the process, and the coffee stain on the documents is then supposed to be symbolic of the multiple stress factors Juno is facing. [...]


Hefter also tries to sprinkle humor throughout the book, which works from time to time [...], but all too often it doesn't, as she opts for the kind of humor that her writing doesn't take too seriously.
