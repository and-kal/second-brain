If you thought this was a book about romance scamming because it has been widely publicized, you will be disappointed. At least there is no in-depth examination of this vile act of exploiting the trust and neediness of others. The main character actually writes with just one love scammer, which develops into a private chat between the two. The author uses this chat-like communication to address topics such as the responsibility of the Western world towards the Third World, but also as a narrative device to reveal certain thoughts and predicaments of her (autobiographical) main character.

Also, the fact that all the characters in the book are named after Roman deities seems to me like a cheap trick that has often been tried to give the characters more depth by adding the possibility of associating the characters with the attributes that come with these ancient gods - a depth that the characters don't have.

I also like the fact that an over-50 author writes about what it's like to get a tattoo again at this age.

I can find all this quite good so far. But I can also find it extremely simple-minded and largely uninteresting.

It's all well and good to choose certain leitmotifs for a novel. However, this often makes the novel feel very redundant, for example when the author explains to us several times that the theater stage is real life for her, where she feels alive and can be everything she can't be in everyday life. In fact, this introspection is already hackneyed the first time and doesn't get any better with repetition. I also don't find it very successful that Lars von Trier's ‘Melancholia’, of all films, has to be used again and again to illuminate the inner life of the main character. Of course, the idea of the end of the world exerts a tremendous fascination on us. [...]
