## Building Abstractions with Procedures

computational processes/procedures manipulate data

*   they are descriptions of rules of manipualtion
*   processes accord to a pattern of rules = a program

procedures and data can be combined and abstracted

Computer programming aids our expression of "procedural thoughts"

"complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity"

variables are stored in an environment

## LISP specificialities

*   uses prefix notation
    *   (_operator_ _...operands_)
*   processes can be treated as data as well
*   every expression has a value
*   LISP programs are usually composed of several simple procedures
