Mythos der Mehrarbeit/Vollbeschäftigung...

Arbeitsplätze schaffen sinnvoller in Forn von mehr Teilzeitarbeitsplätze?...

Automation != less labor demand

> The automation discourse rests on four principal propositions. First, it argues, workers are already being displaced by ever more advanced machines, resulting in rising levels of “technological unemployment.” Second, this displacement is a sure sign that we are on the verge of achieving a largely automated society, in which nearly all work will be performed by self-moving machines and intelligent computers. Third, although automation should entail humanity’s collective liberation from toil, we live in a society where most people must work in order to live, meaning this dream may well turn out to be a nightmare.4 Fourth, therefore, the only way to prevent a mass- unemployment catastrophe—like the one unfolding in the United States in 2020, although for very different reasons—is to institute a universal basic income (UBI), breaking the connection between the size of the incomes people earn and the amount of work they do.

> if output grows more slowly than labor productivity [...] then the number of jobs will decline

!!

> global capitalism is failing to provide jobs for many of the people who need them. There has been, in other words, a persistently low demand for labor

!! [...]

> the labor share of income [i.e. "Lohnquote"] in G7 countries has fallen for decades

Eine sinnvolle Automatisierung wäre eine solche in welcher, die Einsparungen nicht in Form von Profit usgezahlt werden, sondern in Form von weniger Arbeit.

Wirtschaftswachstum spiegelt sich nicht in Lohnanstieg wieder. Einzig das Medianeinkommen (i.e. "die Einkommenshöhe, von der aus die Anzahl der Haushalte bzw. Personen mit niedrigeren Einkommen gleich groß ist wie die der Haushalte mit höheren Einkommen") steigt.

> First, I argue that the decline in the demand for labor of past decades was due not to an unprecedented leap in technological innovation, but to ongoing technical change in an environment of deepening economic stagnation. Second, I contend that this underdemand for labor has tended to manifest not as mass unemployment but rather as persistent underemployment. Third, I point out that the resulting world of poorly paid workers will continue to be accepted or even welcomed by elites, meaning technological advances will by no means automatically entail the adoption of technocratic solutions like universal basic income (meanwhile, even if UBI is introduced, it is much more likely that it will prop up a world of massive inequality than help dismantle it). Fourth, I explain how we might create a world of abundance even without the full or nearly full automation of production. I then project a path by which we might get there, through social struggle rather than administrative intervention.

deindustrialization != offshoring or low-cost imports
-> "more goods are being produced but by fewer workers"
but: labor productivity is not rising fast, growth rates are even falling ("productivity paradox") + real output per person is also shrinking, not growing (<- in high-income countries only? "The truth is that rates of output growth in manufacturing have tended to decline, not only in this or that country, but worldwide")

ΔO – ΔP = ΔE
if productivity grows faster than the industrial output (which is governed by supply and demand?), employment is gonna drop (“output-led deindustrialization”)

> More and more is produced with fewer workers, as the automation theorists claim, but not because technological change has given rise to high rates of productivity growth. Far from it—productivity growth in manufacturing has appeared rapid only because the yardstick of output growth, against which it is measured, has been shrinking. Following economist Robert Brenner, I argue that global waves of deindustrialization find their origins not in runaway technical change, but first and foremost in a worsening overcapacity in world markets for manufactured goods.

> as Brenner has argued, rising manufacturing capacity across the globe quickly generated overcapacity, issuing in a “long downturn” in manufacturing-output growth rates
