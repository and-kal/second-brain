There is a lot of imagery in this book, some of which are very beautiful:

> When she met people she hadn’t seen in years, their faces had changed, aged, turned strange, and no one had tried to prevent it. She hadn’t taken care of them, they had slipped out of her protective hands, which should have held them up above the surface of the water like people drowning. Preoccupied with other things, she hadn’t taken care of the face, and at the very last moment it was replaced by a new one, stolen from a dead or sleeping person, who then had to make do as best he could. It was either too big or too small, and it bore traces of a life that didn’t belong to the new owner. And yet, when you got used to it, glimpses of the original face would appear, just the way old wallpaper will crack and reveal patches of the hidden layer underneath, still fresh and well-preserved and filled with memories of the former tenants of the house.

Some of which are funny:

> She pulled her upper lip down so it covered her teeth, which Gitte found so repulsive, because she thought there was something about every face that offended and challenged the world in the same way as a doctor’s illegible handwriting offends the self-esteem of the pharmacist.

And some of which are pretty arcane, seem to have a meaning, but are not easy to decode:

> She stretched her arms up over her head, as if to show him how harmless she was. Harmless, not worth worrying about. [...] The world shouldn’t be afraid of her, because then she would be afraid of the world. It hit her hard whenever she forgot about this and revealed something of herself which she now fiercely denied...

> Time raised its terrible wings and flew away toward a reality that was not her own. All weight was lifted from her, and she stared up into a blue sky that was studded with memories. Her hand was hidden in [his], and from his lips, which were pressed against her neck, came a strong, sweet smell of childhood and fear endured. The sun glowed on her upturned face, as if it came from within her, torn away from the season of the year.

> Now there were only Gitte’s and Gert’s voices, and they guided her thoughts in the right direction the way you guide the steps of small children who wouldn’t be able to find their way on the steep, tilting floor themselves.

> There’s so little love in the world that the person we have to love the most is the one everyone else has overlooked. The person it takes the most work to love, the one we deep inside find repulsive because she prevents us from getting by easily. The one who is suffering, the one who has been wronged, the spiritually destitute, and the anonymous child who every morning must sit down at his school desk with the nauseating stink of fear handed down for generations.

> She longed for peace and tried to imagine what that word meant. She thought about those evenings during her childhood when her parents weren’t home. She would write verses in her poetry album that they weren’t supposed to see. She imagined how they were preoccupied with something other than her now. Peace meant not existing in other people’s consciousness.
