You'd be surprised how exisential and transcendental going shopping at Marks & Spencer can be.

»He wants her to know that he is aware of his own limitations, of his failure to make anything of their conversations in the morning. Sometimes this failure appears to him as something intrinsic to time itself, as an inner force, like decay. They pass and are forgotten, these interludes in the kitchen. And yet they are always the same«.

»The world always offers a small opportunity for difference, among a large majority of things that are all the same; and equally unfailingly Tonie takes it, only remembering afterwards that being different is not the same as being right.«

»This is the lesson, the sermon: that facts outlive emotions, and that knowledge is therefore more powerful than love. There are infinite things to know, but the capacity for love is just that, a capacity, a space that can hold so much and no more.«

»Claudia remembers, when Lottie was born, the prospect of self-sacrifice coming into view like a landscape seen from an approaching train; she remembers the steady unfolding of it, a place she had never seen before in her life, and herself inescapably bound for it; and then after a while the realisation, pieced together from numerous clues, that this was where her mother had lived all along.«

Während der Rest der Familie ihrem Hund beibringt durch die Hundeklappe zu gehen, bleibt Claudia in ihrem eigenen Gefühlsleben verhaftet, dessen Tiefe nur sie selbst zu erleben vermag, während die Menschen um Claudia nur einen geteilten und hergeleiteten Zugang zu Claudias Inneren haben. »The feeling of letting go, of surrender: it warms her veins like a tranquiliser, spreading its numb bliss. She has blunted the sharp end of life this way. She fades out, her doubt and pain and anxiety left hollow like a casing, like a shell on a beach. She is used to it, to leaving hollowed-out things behind her. They lie scattered in her past, questions to which the answers were never found. What is the right way to live? What is the value of success? And the most important, the most unanswerable: if love is selfish, can it still be considered to be love?« Dies sind Fragen die Claudia nur mit sich selbst ausmachen wird.

Auch ihre Schwägerin Tonie ringt damit, das was sie wirklich fühlt niemand anderem mitteilen zu können bzw. dass diese Innere nie ganz offenlegbar ist. »[Her husband Thomas] doesn’t know that there is anything in her plight he ought to be moved by. And she can never explain it to him, for as a story it revolves around the disclosure of a desire for something that has no name and is itself nameless, that she could arrive at only by a path of negatives that would somewhere along the line have to pass through Thomas himself.«

»[I]t seems to her now that this is the true accomplishment, this informed solitude, this independence. Is it not sad, then, to be alone? Is it, after all, truer, more honourable? She imagines herself and Thomas, old. She images their lives so entangled that they could never be extricated. It would be horrible to die tangled up with another person, not to know precisely what it was that was dying.«

»Tonie feels a kind of nostalgia for her, as she might for a particular song that fits like a key into the lock of time and lets the past come rushing out.«

»It strikes her now that life is not linear, a journey, a passage, but a static process of irreversible accretion. It is perspective that moves, passing over it all like the sun, now illuminating, now casting into shadow. The angle changes, the relation of one thing to another, the proportion of dark to light; but experience itself is block-like, is cumulative and fixed.«

»Yes, it is bewildering, unfathomable, to find that love and loss and despair and hope are cellular, partitive; that in the fragment of each the structure of the whole is present, like the specimens scientists examine under microscopes; the whole structure and character of her life present in these moments of terror and elation.«

Alltägliche Situtationen wie das Vorbereiten auf einen Autourlaub: »Sometimes it is more than a clearing of the air, this business of going away. It is a death and rebirth for them all. The problem is that the holiday, when it comes, sometimes feels like it is happening to someone else.«

So abgedroschen die Frage auch klingen mag, wird sie in dem Roman doch immer wieder eingestreut, um zu ergründen, was den einzelnen Figuren ihren Antrieb gibt: Was ist Kunst? Hat es etwas mit Kreativität zu tun und Zeitlosigkeit zu tun. Oder ist es einfach der Besitz einer Fähigkeit, wie Thomas sich bei einem Besuch im Zirkus und dem Anschauen von Akrobaten fragt. Ist es etwas was immer an Schwermut gekoppelt ist und es deshalb eher ratsam illustrierte Zeitungen lesen?

»[Claudia] set eyes on the tumbledown place at the bottom of the garden and saw in it the reflection of a part of herself. It seemed to stand poised between existence and annihilation, just as she in that moment felt herself to hover, a dissolving image, at the very brink of identity. In its abandonment it had become theoretical, like the mysterious region of herself that life could seem to find no use for, the series of urges to which she gave the name of creativity.«
