Vivino (the app) kind of sucks. So does Letterboxd. And Rate Your Music (even though that's the page [I](https://rateyourmusic.com/~staxl) still like the most of them all). I love keeping track of the cultural goods I consume, like what music I listen to and what movies I watch, but at some point I stopped rating things by numbers or stars or whatever they have at whatever service. (I sometimes still rate for private purposes - just so I know which movies I really hated, or which albums I will love forever and all time.) 

The thing with 5-star ratings is - given that you can also give half stars (so you got 0.5 to 5.0, but no 0.0) - most films and albums will end up having something between 3.1 and 3.9 stars, unless you're watching some really trashy B horror movie - those will have <3.0 (which doesn't mean it's gonna be completely unenjoyable - most of Albert Pyun's movies will be probably have <3.0 average ratings, though they've got some marvelous set design going on) - or you listen to the newest album of some once popular '90s indie band surprised to see their still active - these releases are very likely to be in the 2.x realm as well (for good reasons). 

So the dividing line between "a pretty solid record/movie" and "maybe that'll be a modern classic" is somewhere around 3.6; that's in fact the cutoff point for [bolded albums](https://rateyourmusic.com/discussion/rate-your-music/bolding-community-feedback/) on Rate Your Music, but it also kind of matches my experience. >3.6 movies are mostly really enjoyable. But of course you shouldn't always rely on the canon and also explore more niche releases. 

That being said, I've listened to a lot of music in my life and I can tell a <3.6 from a >3.6 album or movie. But I haven't tried that many wines, which is why I uninstalled Vivino, because all the wines I scanned with the app had 3.4 to 3.6 ratings and it takes too much time to scan all the labels until you find a >3.6 wine and in the end I don't care that much for wine anyway.
