Also tired of Google Fonts but not in a position to pay for font faces? 

I just came across Luc Devroye's [Type Design Information Page](http://luc.devroye.org/opensourcefonts.html), which houses the best list on open source type fonts I've yet seen.

There's also an [awesome fonts list](https://github.com/brabadu/awesome-fonts#free-fonts) on brabadu's Github with useful resources, if you want to move away from Google Fonts eventually.

Among the [Classic Macintosh Typefaces](https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/macfonts) there's also some great stuff. I came across those via this article: *[The Typefaces of Smalltalk-80](https://moritzfuerst.net/projects/smalltalk-type)* by the way.
