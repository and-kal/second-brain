## Vari Pitch Sample

1. record a sample you wanna use pitch in a wierd way
2. under BPMSYNC put that sample in pitch change
3. hit the tap tempo once to see it on the screen
4. hit your sample
5. mess with FX CONTROL 2

## Quick Effect Resample

1. choose a sample (like, PRESS IT)
2. add an effect you like
3. sampling mode (make sure resampling is on) (ORANGE)
4. choose either loop/oneshot/gate sampling mode
5. arm sampling (GREEN)
6. press on your sample key (same as 1)
7. your old no effect sample is now effected.

## Resample Pattern

1. create you pattern.
2. arm resampling, then press sampling (orange)
3. set your sample mode to loop
4. make sure that you set a threshold/note-on to trigger the sampling. set the leng to 4 bars (or how many you want!)
5. arm sampling button (green).
6. press play on the sequencer

OPTIONAL STEPS

(while doing the adjustments BEFORE sampling) in the length of the sample put like 4 bars so it actually loops perfectly in time. thats one of the beauty of the microsampler, you can cut shit to fit EXACTLY to the master tempo. or timestrech shit to fit exactly to it.

## Keygate Sequencer Chop

alright so the microsampler lacks a mark button, and chopping by percent can be a hassle. the keygate is also not as cool as i thought it would be due to need for silences (it's still pretty dope though.) here's a workaround for mark-style Chopping.

1. get your sample looped how you want
2. put sample into sequencer
3. put resample on, keygate on.
4. press play on the sequencer and the key you want the chop on
5. stop sequencer
6. press play, again, next chop, etc.

## Ultimate 1 Keyboard Part Workaround

alright so the 1 keyboard part can be a bitch. usually what is recommended is resampling the whole pattern and laying the next keyboard part on top, but as any SP user probably knows you can't adjust levels after resampling. here's a different Method.

1. create your pattern, lay keyboard part on top.
2. mute EVERTHING EXCEPT keyboard part.
3. resample just the keyboard part
4. delete keyboard part off pattern from step one
5. now just start the pattern, push the key with the keyboard part on it at the appropriate time, and you have the keyboard part on the pattern, the keyboard mode is now free, and all levels remain adjustable.
