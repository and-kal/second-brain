Either consistency and coherence don't matter much to people anymore, or people's belief systems are so vague/fluid/fuzzy that they allow for a lot of assumptions to be true simultaneously.
When Mr. Raw talks to ..., who is selfconsciously saying the looniest stuff (e.g. that his mousemaid is a reptiloid, same as ~85% of humanity), Mr. Raw sits there, nods and says "wow". You get the impression that people are only interested in the constructing of narratives themself and in "learning" alternative truths for the sake of "learning" alternative truths, but not in ....

Like the guy in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY9uuxC_YAQ) put it so well: »Emotional collapse is a luxury most people can't afford [...]. So, propaganda teaches you a habit, not a belief [...]. Selective attention. You learn over time which topics drain you, which conversations leave you empty, which thoughts spiral too far. And without ever deciding consciously, you start avoiding them. [...] You stop trusting, not just the message, but the entire idea of truth in public space. Words stop being careers of meaning and start being signals, noise, atmosphere.«

This also becomes manifest and obvious when the self-proclaimed »König von Deutschland« Peter Fitzek speaks of parallel realities; according to his worldview, there are apparently several possible worlds, and sometimes things jump from one reality to another. With such a worldview, everything can be made plausible, and there are hardly any impossibilities left. Accordingly, even the most abstruse ideas can be nodded along to and accepted without any kind of tension or friction. In the film, you hardly ever see two people debating; the only kind of contradiction that takes place is in the form of lectures and scolding. The group leaders, kings and administrators can correct their subordinates, but there seems to be no possibility of resistance or counterargument.
