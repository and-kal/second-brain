It doesn't take too much time and knowledge to design a simple-to-code, lightweight, easy-to-maintain website, blog or portfolio. You can achieve pretty good results by simply using some CSS framework and/or static sie generator and following along their respective documentations.
Inspired by [this talk at Erfa Essen](https://media.ccc.de/v/petitfoo-webseiten-bauen) (in German) I compiled a bunch of resources for easy, low-level web design purposes. Basically no JavaScript knowledge's required, only a bit of HTML and CSS.

# Web design assets

## CSS templates

If you really just want to use a template and fill it with your content, or if you want to get a professional-looking website template to modify, here's some starting points:

* [HTML5Up](https://html5up.net/) - Customizable website templates in HTML5 + CSS3 (looks really slick and »up-to-date«)
* [IBM's Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/vanilla/) - very nice-looking alternative to Material Design; you can find a lot of website elements on their [CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/XqRbEz/), ready to be copy-pasted
<!-- * [Creative Tim's free Bootstrap themes](https://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/free/) -->

## CSS frameworks

Developing your own design and style system for a website can take a very long time and you might end up with a whole lot of custom CSS rules, media queries etc. for the single components of your page. From my experience, using a CSS frameworks will enhance this process quite a bit as those often come with a lot of defaults that just work visually and allow you to focus on certain aspects of your designs. Frameworks like  Tailwind will also limit your choices with regards to sizes, spacing etc., which I find helpful in coming up with a consistent design. However, for most of these frameworks you will need to dedicate some time learning the syntax.

* [Sakura](https://oxal.org/projects/sakura/) - »a minimal classless css framework / theme«
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I find this one quite accessible
* [Fomantic-UI](https://github.com/fomantic/Fomantic-UI/) - an active fork of the seemingly deprecated Semantic-UI
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - »a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use front-end components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces«
