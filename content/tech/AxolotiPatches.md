This is a list and collection of interesting patches for the [Axoloti](http://www.axoloti.com/) instrument, which seems to be slowly dying as a project unfortunately. At the moment of writing this, [the community forum](http://community.axoloti.com/) is giving me a `Bad Gateway` error and the project seems to be [kind of abandoned](https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti) by it's creator. Though there was a handful of people still active in the forum. Maybe the forum, which was also a place for sharing patches, will be back soon. But just in case, here's some great patches I salvaged from there:

- [Drone_Machine.axp](/Axoloti-patches/Drone_Machine.axp) by gui7
- [hardc0re k1ck midi.axp](/Axoloti-patches/hardc0re&#32;k1ck&#32;midi.axp) by KelvinT
- [midi looper full fat v5.0.axp](/Axoloti-patches/midi-looper-full-fat-v5.0.axp) by MattilynMattroe
- [midi looper basic cheap v5.0.axp](/Axoloti-patches/midi-looper-basic-cheap-v5.0.axp) by MattilynMattroe
- [mono2poly.axp](/Axoloti-patches/mono2poly.axp) by Ott
- [ORGAN_1](/Axoloti-patches/ORGAN_1) by floodcomics
- [supergran_v1.0.axp](/Axoloti-patches/supergran&#32;v1.0&#32;upload.axp) by MattilynMattroe

And here's some patches I found elsewhere:

- [6 voice karplus strong](/Axoloti-patches/karplus-1.zip) by [dreamer](https://patchstorage.com/author/dreamer/)
- [AxolotiPatches](https://github.com/vormplus/AxolotiPatches) by [vormplus](https://github.com/vormplus)

And of course, the objects from the [Axoloti Community Library](http://www.privatepublic.de/public/community-objectlist.html) are great in themselves.

The Axoloti really is a great platform and probably the most affordable soundboard for creating your own instruments and devices. The patcher is quite intuitive and easy to learn. With little effort you could build practical devices, intricate instruments etc. Much like you can do with the [monome norns](https://norns.community/) or the [Zynthian](https://norns.community/), but at a fraction of the price (though the Axoloti allows for not as complex patches as does the norns for example).
